		"notes": "This game is the first use of the playfield spinner by a U.S. manufacturer. The spinner had already been used in French pinball machines, such as Rally's 1967 'Playboy'.Pictured in this listing is a backglass with no color silkscreening, just black ink on clear glass. The artwork is different than the production backglass art. We asked former Williams employee Duncan Brown to identify and explain this item. He replies:That's a \"keyline\" version of the glass.  For both glasses and playfields I've seen keylines done (sometimes on the wood or glass, sometimes just on a large sheet of mylar or paper).  It's a cheap and easy early check method for the art.  For instance, in the case of a backglass, it is used to make sure that all the score display holes line up properly, before going to all the extra work of cutting the color screens and printing the glass.  If you look at any playfield or backglass, you can see that there's always a keyline layer (first one printed on a glass, last one printed on a playfield) that traps the separate colors, gives some edge definition to the art near blank areas, contains the text messages, etc.  That pencil sketch of the Vagabond backglass I sent you is essentially a keyline.  I'm kind of surprised that one that old lasted all these years.  By and large they were something to be used during the design process and then discarded.  Interesting too that the art completely changed!  I guess that's another reason for a keyline - to make sure that The Powers That Be like the direction the art is headed...Also pictured is a game having a backglass that matches the artwork of the keyline glass. The game was purchased (with this glass installed) from a distributor in Long Island, New York at a date the owner estimates as before 1980. The game has a mid-production serial number 71396 and looks like a regular production game in all other respects, including having ten match number lamps on its backbox insert even though the backglass itself does not have match numbers. While the front of the backglass is professionally done, the reverse side is less so, and Duncan Brown theorizes that this glass may have been hurriedly prepared for a trade show. He notes that neither this glass nor the keyline glass carry the Williams logo as might be expected. We do not know how this 'prototype' glass came to be on this mid-production game prior to 1980 nor how it got from Chicago to New York. Perhaps the original glass broke and a desperate operator contacted Williams to be shipped this glass as a left-over. In later years, select pinball parts retailers in Chicago would purchase from the manufacturers their prototype and leftover backglasses for resale to hobbyists including those who lived out-of-state, but we do not know if any such retailers existed or operated in this way back in the 1970�s.While we do not know who is the artist for this Williams game, the King that is shown on the keyline and prototype glass reappears intact on the backglass for Gottlieb's 1971 'Drop-A-Card' and again on Gottlieb's 1972 'Pop-A-Card', both games attributed to artist Gordon Morison. Morison hired on with Advertising Posters in late 1969, but was under exclusive contract to Gottlieb, and for this same King to appear on a Williams backglass a year ahead of the Gottlieb games only seems probable if there was collaboration between artists at Advertising Posters. Perhaps Morison lent his art to help out the Williams artist who, as Duncan theorizes, was hurriedly trying to get the prototype backglass ready for a trade show. Pinball artist Christian Marche was already employed at Advertising Posters when Morison was hired and, in an interview published in The Pinball Compendium 1970-1981, Marche said they shared a large studio there, adding, \"Gordon and I had always worked side by side, sharing ideas. We liked to work together and we had great esteem for each other.\" This suggests that Marche could be the artist for 'Aces & Kings' production glass, if not also the King on the keyline and prototype glass, but this game is not on a list of his games that Marche compiled in 1992.  It may be argued that the King is not drawn to the standards of Morison, yet the artwork does have the \"single pointing finger\", an idea frequently found on his backglasses."

One earlier form of \"auto-flipping\" appears on Williams' 1953 'Palisades'.This game broke all previous sales records for flipper games. Designer Pat Lawlor wanted to commemorate the actual record-breaking game from the production line and arranged to have it made in a gold cabinet. This change caused a number of games made subsequent in this original run to also have gold cabinets. At least their lower cabinets were gold, even if their backboxes were still made in blue. Included in this listing are pictures of one such example of this \"Later Production\" version having the mixed gold and blue. The legs, metal trim, and lockdown bar are not gold.Then, in 1994, The Addams Family was put back in production with a special run of 'Gold Edition' machines to further commemorate this machine becoming the best selling flipper game of all time.  These machines had many more Gold accents, such as the metal ramps, gold legs and bolts, gold lettering, the vault plastic, the bumper caps and Thing's box. Each \"Gold\" machine includes a certificate signed by the members of the design team and a gold plate on the lower right front of the machine containing the machine number.Larry Demar talks about how Later Production games could exist with mixed gold and blue cabinet art:The way our line worked, the cabinets and backboxes were created separately then joined later and this created a logistical problem for keeping gold with gold and blue with blue along with the likelihood that we had more spoilage in backboxes than cabinets (or the other way around) meant that a small number of games were mis-matched.Pat Lawlor comments further on these Later Production games:The record breaking game was #20,232. That game is the one we all had our picture taken in front of, and then on the cover of Replay. The inside of the game was signed by every worker on the line that day, and is in the possession of Gene Cunningham.Larry, you are correct that the final few games were made with the Gold. That's because you do not just make 1 cabinet when you are doing screen print production, you make many. Once the change was made, they just kept making them. Yes, there are mis-matched cabinets out there, probably orphans on the \"hospital\" line at the factory. That's the area where games with problems were kept until the techs could get around to fixing them for shipment. Another possibility is that Odd parts were sometimes assembled to get the last few games of any run out the door.Pictured in this listing is a plastic for the bookcase having text that is not seen on production games. Pat Lawlor explains why:The art for the plastics had to be approved and sent for production 3 weeks before prototype games were built. During early play testing we noticed that people could not figure out how to open the vault. So we changed the art for later plastics, but in order to use the ones already in house we put the sticker on them. It happened all the time with changes from testing to production. It was a normal part of the business.",

This Special Edition commemorates that event.Like the original, this edition has a flipper that not only is controlled by the player's flipper button but also is caused by the game programming to flip at certain points in game play. One earlier form of \"auto-flipping\" appears on Williams' 1953 'Palisades'.This edition has Gold accents, such as the metal ramps, gold legs and bolts, gold lettering, the vault plastic, the bumper caps and Thing's box. Each of the (only) 1000 \"Gold\" machines includes a certificate signed by the members of the design team and a gold plate, containing the machine number, on the lower right front of the machine.Machine #1 is property of Pat Lawlor himself. (see more information on Pat Lawlor and The Addams Family at http://www.patlawlordesign.com/playmeter.htm)We asked Pat if any playfields from the original 1992 run were used for this Special Edition. He replies:It's POSSIBLE that there were a few old playfields used for GOLD. But unlikely. Here's why. What many people will find unbelievable is that, at the end of the regular run of Addams Family, the remaining playfields that were not designated for parts sales were destroyed. Crushed in a large compactor. I personally saw racks of playfields go to the crusher. That's because Williams never ran second releases later. And that inventory would have had to have been stored somewhere in the building. It was more cost effective to write down the inventory than keep it. When the decision was made to do the Gold Run of 1000 games, new playfields were ordered and used. My game has a playfield made by Lenc-Smith [Manufacturing Company] in March of the build year. Impossible for the regular run! Now maybe a game was repaired with an old playfield from parts sales, but I do not believe that you could make a case that the entire run of Golds was old playfields. (My game proves that is incorrect).Larry DeMar points out that the Gold  playfield is indeed different:The PMS values for several of the colors were changed to make them \"hotter\".  Side by side, it is easy to tell apart playfields from the original run from the new run which used the same screens with different colors.",

The unusual shooter lane curve will aim a ball strongly shot into play directly towards the left outlane and its drop target. An operator option allows this drop target to be in the up position at the start of every ball. Two-ball multi-ball with double playfield scoring. Alpha-numeric displays. Hinged backbox. The backbox and lower cabinet bottom and front are metal while the lower cabinet sides are wood. Two sturdy metal columns elevate the backbox allowing the playfield to extend under it. Each fuse in backbox has a lit green LED indicating the fuse is good.The upper playfield has left and right return lanes each allowing the player to shoot the ball through a spinning target and back to the top of the playfield. At the top of these return lanes are wireform gates controlled by the CPU. The player can hit targets and rollovers to open one or both of these gates. If the left gate is open, the player can complete a ball orbit through both spinners by shooting through the right-side return lane. Similarly, if the right gate is open, the player can complete a ball orbit through both spinners by shooting through the left-side return lane. Completing an orbit with green light flashing will light 'Barren X Zone' insert in center playfield for immediate doubling of playfield scoring until the green light goes out.Sound: electronic, no knocker.Factory-installed illumination: Backbox - one fluorescent tube. Playfield - all lamps are incandescent.Cabinet - front has all incandescent lamps.",
		"notes": "This is the first pinball machine from any manufacturer to be produced with alpha-numeric displays. It was used to spell out words and messages in addition to scores. The Wico manual referred to the upper wireform gates as \"programmable\" as if to suggest that there are operator options for them. However, the manual has no such operator options. The gates each have a coil to open and close them and are under exclusive programmed control by the CPU.The manual also referred to all three solitary drop targets as \"programmable drop targets\" each having a small coil used to drop the target under programmed control of the CPU. Here, however, they do indicate an operator option but only for one of the three targets, the one in the left outlane (per page 18 of the manual) to place it in the up position at the start of every ball. Reportedly, in Early Production games, both left and right outlane drop targets had trouble with their operation causing the removal of the small coil during production. This trouble should also have affected the solitary drop target in front of the kick-out hole such that we would expect its small coil to have been removed as well. The manual does have a parts drawing for both the version with the small coil (the programmable version) and the version without the small coil (used for the E-S-C and A-P-E drop targets).Artist Constantino Mitchell told us that Wico kept the designer's identity a secret. His wife Jeanine did all the color work for the backglass, playfield, plastics, and cabinet. She also modeled for the artwork.An earlier game, Williams' 1981 'Hyperball', had an alpha-numeric display but is Not A Pinball."

He replied, \"We want to leave the market wanting.\"  [Steve refers to Gorgar here:] \"Gor's brother Al\" is what we used to call Algar.  The Gar family kind of died after that.

I think Al was just a dud of a game.In The Pinball Compendium 1970-1981, designer Claude Fernandez stated he left Williams for Bally while this game was at the whitewood stage and the project was then passed to Tony Kraemer.

It appears to have been their last pin game. The design of pins and pockets resembles a Whiffle game. While we list this game as non-electrical, the information seem inconclusive as to whether this game is electromechanical or entirely mechanical.Automatic Age March 1933 page 40 describes the various exhibitors at the February show and states this game \"was shown in two models, with or without a self-loading jackpot feature. It is an improved pin table with a pay-off.

This shows a decision was made by Williams to eliminate four steps in this carry-over feature. While this decision likely was made before production began, if anyone has a Sample or Early Production game, please let us know, so we can see whether it has ten or fourteen steps of animation.Near each upper flipper is a playfield hole where a lamp should be. There are no lamp sockets wired to these holes. Under the playfield, the end-of-stroke switch for each flipper required the space where the light socket would be.'Alpine Club' was the first Williams game to have these features:� a hinged door on the front of the backbox for easy access to the backglass or to change bulbs.� a backglass marquee for advertising.� an automatic ball lift.� a one-piece lockdown bar.� the now-familiar plastic rectangular ball shooter escutcheon.� a coin return flap.� a new coin door designed to accommodate nickels, dimes, and quarters in a single slot. Prior to this, each denomination required it's own coin slot. This new design required a larger coin acceptor and a larger coin door than before. To accommodate the larger door, the front of the wood cabinet was extended downward. This drop-down cabinet style was used on subsequent games through mid-1966 when its use ended during the production run of Williams' 1966 'A-Go-Go'."

		"notes": "Same playfield layout as Gottlieb's 1971 'Lawman' but without the free ball gate, bonus ladder, and other inserts.Designer Jeff Brenner left Gottlieb before this game was produced, and he was unaware that any examples were made having the half-circle replay unit until we contacted him about it. He shares with us other information about this game: I designed this game at the request of Wayne Neyens and Judd Weinberg, who wanted me to design a single-player version of Sheriff.  The playfield design was basically Eddie Krynski's Sheriff / Lawman. I removed the \"paper clip\" free ball gate.  The game also featured the newer style mini-posts which had much more bounce than their predecessors used on Sheriff.  Wayne Neyens introduced two changes to the right return lane.  He placed a pin above the flipper to help block balls from rolling up the lane and draining on the right.  He also extended the playfield plastic to its weird shape to help stop balls from lofting over the return lane wireform and draining.  Apparently he felt that the left side not having a return lane handicapped the player enough.  I designed the ruleset for Atlantis in its entirety.  When I designed it, I had the top three advance lights moving from right to left.  When the production schematic designer / draftsman, Robert Moravec, redid the circuit schematic, he reversed the lane light direction to left to right.  I asked to have it changed back to right to left, but it remained as left to right when it went into production.  Noteworthy on this game was my concept of awarding a scoring premium for hitting two adjacent drop targets simultaneously.  I always had wished it had been used again, as it was very rewarding to the player, whenever it occurred.  To emphasize the feature, I wanted it produced with bullseye circles which spanned each pair of adjacent targets as I had done on the whitewood original prototype, but Judd Weinberg decided that the blue and white fish design fit the theme of the game better so they went with that.  I have read the comments of some of the other players on IPDB as well as players I talked to on location, and all agreed that this was a rewarding feature.Pictured in this listing is an Early Production game with serial number 01110 and which has the half-circle replay unit and green bumper caps that are found on the game in the manufacturer's flyer. It does not have the extended right slingshot plastic as found in games made later in the production run. We do not have a picture of the lower cabinet serial number to know if it had the \"S\" suffix to signify a Sample game."

A resurgence of pinball brought Game Plan back into making pinballs and in 1984 this game was finally produced. However, John was with Gottlieb by this time and still possessed his artwork, so new art was done for the game, although John's playfield layout was still used. He has provided for this listing some film photographs of his 1981 art.Artist Larry Blazek told us that he did the (new) art for the playfield and plastics, and Tom Smeltzer did the art for the backglass."

		"notes": "A rotating handle on the front of the cabinet allows the player to pivot a small section of the playfield side wall, the \"rubber banking cushion\", to adjust the angle in which the ball leaving the shooter lane enters the playfield. This pivoting flange can be positioned to be flush with the side wall, or perpendicular to it, or at any angle in between. It takes many rotations of the handle to adjust the angle, thus it would be something done prior to shooting the ball into play and not while the ball was in motion. The propelled ball will bank against the flange, hopefully towards the desired score hole area. Four of the score holes have rubber housings around their upper side such that balls can only fall into them if rebounding from below, a difficult feat on this flipperless game. A ball falling through any hole will roll down the drain board over any or all of five rollovers. The score reel advances 200 points for each rollover. The red post at the bottom of the playfield is stationary and scores no points when hit. Balls draining below it score no points.The score reel mechanism has two dummy zeroes in its display. It also contains a rubber wheel of embossed score values and an inkpad. When a new game is started, the previous game�s score is recorded in ink on a paper tape reel. The tape, which is not reusable, slowly unspools over the course of many games into a storage compartment provided for it. This tape allows the operator and the location to agree on what final scores were obtained and, because payouts were paid by the location, this feature was advertised by the manufacturer as a solution to any disputes regarding collections.Reportedly, this game has an electric tilt mechanism. When activated, the top part, visible to the player, shows the word \"TILTED\". Its internal mechanism is boxed in, apparently inaccessible to even the operator. We asked a game owner how this mechanism detects a tilt violation and how it resets, and his reply says it best:I, and others, cannot see how the tilt works. There is a rod that goes from the readable tilt down through a hole in the bottom of the inside of the front door. This space is not accessible anywhere that anybody can see. Not from the top, side or even under the game. No access screws. Nothing. The hole the rod goes through is the same size as the rod, preventing it from moving side to side like a conventional pendulum tilt. Your guess is as good as any. It is electric, but the wires are not attached. The top part of the tilt is reset by the coin slide being pushed in.The playfields for Autobank, Autocount, and Autowhirl used the same cabinet and were interchangeable. The operator could buy another playfield to fit in his existing cabinet."

		"features": "7 balls for 1 cent, or 10 balls for 5 cents. This is a Square Machine, advertised as 24 1/2 inches square, and 8 1/4 inches high. One manufacturer ad included in the price a choice of a metal stand or wooden legs, for a total height of 36 1/4 inches. One of the games pictured here measured 23 1/2 inches square and 9 inches high. Both the wooden legs and metal stand attach to the cabinet with screws.",
		"notes": "The playfield on this game is saucer-shaped and the shutter panel that keeps the trapped balls from falling through (aka baffle board) is also saucer-shaped but with its holes slightly offset. When the player pushes the coin chute to deposit a new coin, this curved shutter does not move back and forth like those on games with flat playfields, but instead slightly rotates on a central axis, aligning its holes with the playfield holes so that the trapped balls drop down towards the ball-lift.In an interview published in 1982 in The Pinball Collectors' Quarterly, Bally Vice President Herb Jones explained they never could get the mechanics right on the rotating shutter panel, making the alignment of upper and lower holes erratic. Balls would get stuck and not fall through. As a result, he said, almost the entire run of this game was returned to the factory for refund or credit. Thousands of these games were scrapped by Bally, and their cabinets were salvaged to make Bally's 1933 'Mike and Ike'.Of the cabinet examples pictured here, four show ball lifts, all different from each other. The cabinet photos attributed to Higgins show no external ball lift knob, as the lift is built into the ball shooter, where pulling back the shooter lifts the ball up to playing level. The cabinet photos attributed to Lankar show a round wooden knob on its right side, and the playfield sticker advises the player to turn this knob to 'release' balls. We are not certain if this knob releases balls to the ball shooter, or if it is used at the very start of play to drop all balls through the playfield holes as a solution to any problems encountered when the coin slide did it. The cabinet photos attributed to Ricci show a metal lever on the front, below the shooter knob, to lift the balls up. This third game also had extensive reconstruction inside, replacing metal with wood and vice versa, clearly not by the factory, so its ball lift style may not be original either. The cabinet photos attributed to Dodel show a metal ball lift knob on the side.A Billboard article dated July 30, 1932 mentions a report from Bally President Ray Maloney that Ballyround had been \"greatly improved\" but does not elaborate. We know games with the combined lift-and-shooter were advertised in May of 1932. We would think the great improvement was with the troublesome baffle board. The fourth cabinet shown here appears to have all original internal construction. We have no pictures of the inside of the first two cabinet styles to evaluate further.According to the Encyclopedia of Pinball Vol 1, Bally wanted to name this game 'Scram' until they discovered another game was being marketed under that name, Hutchison Engineering Company's 1932 'Scram'."

According to the book All About Pinball, Paradise and its add-a-ball version Pleasure Isle were the first games designed to have return lanes. However, Gottlieb rescheduled the production of Bank-A-Ball so that it could be released first.Pictured in this listing is an Early Production playfield that matches the playfield shown in the manufacturer's flyer. The return lane white arrows show the words \"Lights Bumpers\" in them. Also, the lower playfield shows the 8-ball as an actual illuminating insert. Sometime during production, the words were moved to be below the arrows and the illuminating insert was removed, leaving the 8-ball painted on solid wood. The example we picture shows a certificate with serial number 01072. We know that Sample games do not show the 'S' designator on the certificate but only show it stamped into the wood of the cabinet. It's possible this game is a Sample."

This allowed Banzai Run to play sounds when the flipper buttons are pressed in attract mode where flippers are not activated.Larry DeMar provided these comments:I can confirm that Banzai Run had 3 balls although it only ever needed 2.  The software was capable of adjusting to a missing ball and not putting the game out of service.  I suspect it is correct that this was the first time this was done.  Later WMS games would adjust down to any number of balls (at least 1) available, but this was where it started.I'm not sure about whether it was the first to use low voltage switches for the flipper buttons, but it was the first that I programmed to make an attract mode sound when the button was pressed so it is likely that this is true.",

Pinball designer/programmer Larry Demar stated in an interview that the original name of the game was 'Las Vegas', eventually becoming 'Jet Orbit'. Artist Doug Watson told us that the name changed again when he created the art. Inspired by Swiss artist H.R. Giger, Doug drew a predatory fish morphing into a model's head \"against a landcape of teeth\", and he named her 'Barracuda'. He presented his drawing to Mike Stroll, President of Williams, who liked the art but felt the name 'Barracuda' had negative connotations. Mike and a few other people who were present were starting to think of an alternate name on the spot. Doug quickly suggested 'Barracora' as the woman's name, and Mike loved it. Doug proceeded to discreetly make naked 'Barracoras' on the playfield.Compare the backglass art to H.R. Giger's painting, \"Li I\". Information about the artwork can be found here."

		"notes": "Pictured in this listing is a unique game with a blue backglass and blue playfield. It appears to be an authentic manufacture from Williams of which we have no information other than the game itself and what the owner can tell us. The owner obtained the game in 1999 from northern New York from a collector who bought games in that general area. The machine was coined 2/25c and 3 balls per play. To assist any forensic study of this game, we offer several pictures along with some of the information given by the owner:The cabinet: The colors look the same as other games. He repainted the backbox as well as the entire front of the cabinet. He touched up the cabinet sides with paint and then waxed.The playfield: The yellow targets (four in middle and two at top) are translucent except the target marked '12' is opaque and came from a 'Beat Time' parts machine. The pop bumpers had gray wood-grain protectors that he replaced with smaller clear ones. Removing the old protectors revealed a lime-green color underneath. He states the picture(s) really bring out the contrast between this blue and green but to the eye it is not so extreme.The backglass: The owner touched up a few small specks in the jackets of the people, a few thin lines in the snare drum, and coated the match numbers with a watered-down backing color.The serial number: The serial number on the front of the cabinet was gouged up and barely readable, and his repaint of the entire front now covers it completely. The number on the paper card on the upper apron has long since faded away. The only apparent serial number remaining is located inside the backbox as #90909. Compared to the range of serial numbers reported to the Internet Pinball Serial Number Database, #90909 is very low in the production run for 'Beat Time' but not the lowest number they have.In summary, while color fade may be an arguable point for either playfield or backglass, it doesn't account for all the color differences that are present. For instance, the girl's red hair in the area overlapping the bass drum could not be the result of fade. We believe serial number #90909 makes this an example of an Early Production game, and we have marked the images accordingly.Backglasses that show the name 'The Beatles' instead of 'The Bootles' are fully new backglasses, or modified factory glasses, both not original to production."

		"notes": "In the Encyclopedia of Pinball Volume 1, author Dick Bueschel writes that movie theaters, in order to increase attendance during the Great Depression, would give gifts to patrons or would draw for prizes using the numbers on the ticket stubs. In 1936, 'Bank Night' was started, which was a cash giveaway of five to twenty dollars to the lucky patron with the matching ticket stub numbers, but the winner had to be present to collect, otherwise the amount would increase for the next show.This pinball machine carried the same theme, as shown on the backglass and the playfield holes. The Register holes represented buying the movie ticket, the Winning Number holes compared to matching the ticket stub, and scoring a Player Present hole was necessary to collect the prize. Lights on the backglass reflect when each of these three functions was achieved. Artwork in the lower playfield shows patrons up on stage in front of the spinning cage used to draw the winning tickets.There are two ways to win:1) Scoring 4 holes in a row horizontally, vertically, or diagonally in the upper playfield grid.2) Scoring one of the two Register holes, both Winning Number holes, and either of the Player Present holes would award the player the value shown on the lower playfield Bank Dial. If no win, then the Bank Dial would increment as a carry-over feature to the next game until it was won. This dial also increased every time the Bank Increases hole was made.This game is not equipped with a payout mechanism, but payouts would be made by the location if the backglass showed the Register, Winning Number, and Player Present components were achieved. The payout would range from 50 cents to $2.50.Bueschel also writes that this game has slanted woodrails, not only for appearances' sake but to prevent the parking of cigarettes on it. He seems to suggest that either Rock-Ola was the first manufacturer to do this, or this was their first game to have this."

I have had many examples of these machines over the years. Playfields with PAINT over [flipper] swipe area and top arch are made of CHIPBOARD! I first saw this at Cleveland Coin back in the day when we were thinking of buying the game off the floor. Our salesman told us to take one in the box as the painted over area was \"Pressed wood\". I later talked to Cliff Strain [in Sales] at an annual trade show. He told me they were trying new materials because of a spike in the price of plywood. I have had two of these three machines since then, and the paint seems to stick to the wood just fine, but the surface turns rough and bumpley (sic) under the paint."

Freres does not recall the distributor's specific reason for the name change or how it actually affected the Black Belt production run, and offers the possibility that all games shipped as Black Belt and then Bally shipped the new glasses later.It could be that the name was changed for Europe to avoid confusion with Zaccaria's 1986 'Blackbelt' released a few months before.We presume the Production Run quantity of 600 shown here includes the games having the Karate Fight backglasses."

		"notes": "For several Williams games (especially before 1987), Speech Processing was a separate task than Software Programming and may have been done by a different person than whom we list as having done the Software. Paul Dussault did the English Speech Processing for this game.Black Knight' introduced 'Magna-Save' and the Bonus Ball concept where the player with the highest score won additional seconds of free play. Magna-Save was a feature where a user could press a button on either side and magnets would prevent the ball from draining via that outlane. It would stop and hold the ball and drop it into the inlane. The user had to perform some task to re-enable magnasave.Steve Ritchie confirmed his voice was used on this game.Comments from designer Steve Ritchie:Black Knight was the first game ever to employ faceted inserts (the transparent inlaid plastic windows) in the playfield. My design was a simple eight-sided \"Jewel Look\", but insert texturing progressed from there to many different designs, finally settling on refracting radial lines originating at the center of round and rectangular inserts and from points of arrows and lightning bolts, etc.In the beginning of the production run, the transformer was located in the backbox, and the game used power supply board part# D-7999, with a stand-alone General Illumination Relay mounted to the backbox floor. During production, the transformer was moved to the lower cabinet and the G.I. Relay was then mounted on a new power supply board, part# D-8345.Pictured in this listing is the inside backbox of an Early Production game having System 7 boards in it, except for the power supply board which is System 6. The serial number of the game is 460804 and the playfield has \"Dec 2 1980\" on it. Reportedly, several more games with System 6 power supplies have been sighted in Germany and they likely are also Early Production, but no serial numbers for them have been identified to us.From France, we have a picture of the inside lower cabinet for an Early Production game having serial number 458205 and the owner states it has a regular System 6 Power board. This picture shows a board upon which rests the line filter and the main power fuse. The transformer, normally found on this board in later games in the production run, is located in the backbox.Also pictured in this listing is a Pre-Production backglass owned for many years by Steve Ritchie. The knight's armor is a teal color, not gray like in production glasses. Only one was made. The current owner states this glass is a lot thinner than regular backglasses, and that artist Tony Ramunni's signature on it is different.Also pictured in this listing is a stripped playfield from the game with serial number 457797. Three of the four slots cut into this playfield for the drop target banks also have a cutout to support a vertical rebound switch. The switch can be seen in the flyer game if one looks carefully at the center drop bank. We do not know how many production games had these switches. Games that do not have switches might still have the playfield cutouts. Other games might not even have the cut outs. Steve Ritchie explains:The switch was removed because it never really got a chance to be hit much.  The timers would reset the banks, so they weren't exposed often enough to justify the cost of keeping them.'Black Knight' was the first solid state game with a multi-level playfield. Examples of earlier games with multi-level playfields are Fisher & Coe Manufacturing Company's 1933 'Grand Central' and Chicago Vending Company's 1934 'Three Point'."

Reportedly, the \"futuristic\" artwork may be the earlier design.Steve Ritchie confirmed his voice (and not Rich Karstens) is the voice of the Black Knight in this game.  Stephanie Rogers and Glo Van Vlack are the voices of the Choir of Angels.We asked Steve about an image in this listing showing a sticker affixed to the upper playfield back wall advertising the sale of BK T-shirts. He replies:The sticker is authentic.  It was printed and attached to later games on the back panel, but most were removed by owners and operators.  The same message is basically presented in the dmd at different times during the attract mode, but someone in marketing said \"What if the game is turned off?\"  and, \"It is good to point out the free T-shirt feature to operators and players.\" The sticker had low intensity adhesive and was easily peeled off without leaving marks.",

This was accomplished using a relay mounted to the backbox floor, called the G.I. Relay, which cut power to all playfield lamps.Prior to \"Blackout\", all solid state games from this manufacturer used four bolts to attach the backbox to the cabinet. With \"Blackout\" and later games, Williams used only two bolts even if the steel was still stamped for four holes.Compare the backglass artwork to the front cover page of the November 1968 issue of the Nick Fury, Agent of S.H.I.E.L.D. comic book."

The inserts are labeled 20-100-20-100-150-20, and the 2X and 3X markings on the left lanes are reversed, Also, the drop targets have no design on them.At a Chicago Expo 2012 presentation, artist Greg Freres stated this game started out as \"E.T.\" (the movie) but they couldn�t get the license. He also confirmed to us that four in-house artists collaborated on this game: Greg did the backglass, Kevin O'Connor did the playfield, Margaret Hudson did the playfield plastics, and Pat McMahon did the cabinet art."

		"notes": "This may be the first pinball machine designed with bumpers. Each bowling pin bumper has a long, thin rod attached and is mounted via a coil spring so that movement in any direction may be achieved. The Bolo bumper was developed by W. VonStoeser and was a prototype of the passive bumper found on pinball machines that followed.According to Dick Bueschel's Encyclopedia of Pinball Vol 2 , production of this game initially was jobbed out to suppliers all around Utica, New York, who not only made the components but assembled the games. These first games were non-payout and were introduced in Billboard magazine in July 1936. In September, Pacent leased a new, larger location and began making the games themselves under one roof. In December 1936, they began making Payout and Ticket versions. Demand for these games was so great that production could not keep up, and backorders grew. Bally President Ray Maloney, who had been looking for the next great idea, seized the opportunity and swiped the bumper concept from Bolo, improved it, patented the improvement, and began making Bally's 1936 'Bumper'. In a 1985 telephone interview, it was former New York operator Johnny Belotta who told Bueschel that Maloney swiped the bumper idea from Bolo and that nothing about it was published in the media at the time. The demand shifted to Bally's game from all directions at the same time that interest in Bolo had waned. Pacent filed for bankruptcy by mid-1937.In 1960, inventor and pinball designer Harry Mabs contacted Cash Box magazine to state that it was he who invented the bumper, in 1934, on a game he identified as \"Washington\", on location in 1934 in Miami, Florida. He states he sold that game to Ray Maloney who, Mabs said, in turn made Bumper. We have included the magazine editorial where his comments appear. In it, he does not mention who manufactured his game and we infer a small quantity was made, local to the Miami area. Other than this editorial, we have found no information on a game called \"Washington\" to confirm that his invention was in fact a device that interacted with a round pinball and not, say, a coin (such as a coin pusher machine), or if the game was indeed a pinball machine and not an arcade game. Although we are hesitant to imagine from Mabs' comments that he could be inexact in what he conveys, we note that Mabs has also said he made the first game with flippers, which we know is a true statement only if conditions are applied to it. Mabs does not say when he sold his 1934 game to Maloney, and we do not know if Belotta, an operator in upstate New York, would have had knowledge about a game in Miami. Perhaps this Bolo game of July 1936 was not Maloney's sole inspiration for his December 1936 game, Bumper, but certainly a catalyst.The photographs in this listing are of a game that is neither the payout or ticket version."

The three balls are then dumped from the pocket back to the player to shoot again, accompanied by a simulated bombing noise which is a crude hammer inside the machine striking the bottom of cabinet.The Encyclopedia of Pinball Volume 2 quotes this info from Automatic Age magazine of January 1936:In BOMBER, Rock-Ola's ingenious sound effects device reproduces the actual sound of a bomb as it hits its target. When the bomb hits, a brilliant flash of light accompanies the explosion!"

In that same magazine issue, United announced the addition of chrome side rails to this game. It appears United made a quick business decision soon after this game came out, perhaps a response to Williams Manufacturing�s recent conversion to metal side rails on their bat games as seen on their '1962 World Series' which had debuted in January. The pictures we have of United�s game show their thin-looking metal rails are nailed directly onto the wood rails, not as impressive as the solidly attached wide trim that Williams had done. It appears that United was lagging behind competitively on this development.We searched Billboard through May 1962 but found no picture ads after March and no further mention after April. 'Bonus Baseball' is the last bat game from this manufacturer."

The scene likely is intended to portray Paul Revere's historic midnight ride to Lexington on April 18, 1775 to warn Samuel Adams and John Hancock that British troops were on the march to arrest them. In the background, a light shines from the bell tower of Boston's Christ Church. However, Revere didn't start his journey on horseback until after he had left Boston, having been first rowed across the Charles River to Charlestown by associates, and there he borrowed a horse to start his ride. Fellow patriot William Dawes was also dispatched from Boston to Lexington for the same reason as was Revere, but Dawes was the one who took the land route through Boston. Therefore, history would have the man on horseback in Boston be William Dawes. If anyone has access to this game, please contact us with your photographs. We hope to document and explain in detail the �Handicap Equalizer� feature that is advertised in the manufacturer�s flyer."

		"features": "5 balls for 5 cents. Trap holes (25). Mirrored backglass.Sound: knocker",
		"notes": "This listing represents Bally 'Broadway' Model 535 and previously carried an incorrect name of 42nd and Broadway. The schematic part number is W-348c showing an issue date of 1951.The earliest Billboard ad that we found for this game (not shown here) is a distributor ad dated Sept-1-1951 page 85 and it referred to this game as \"new\". We have not found any ads placed by the manufacturer.The pictures in this listing show that Bally's six-card Bright Lights bingo game from April 1951 was reused to make this one-card game by mounting in the backbox the light board for a single large bingo card directly onto the front of the insert of that earlier game, covering its six smaller cards. Several stepper units in the backbox for multiple card operation have been manually disabled. The backbox itself is deeper in size when compared to Bright Lights, probably to accommodate the extra space required behind the backglass for the added light board. The underside of the playfield is tagged 'Bright Lights' and the playfield art design is the same. The cabinet art is the same, however the paint lines on the coin door do not fully coincide with those of the cabinet. This coin door is further different, having a start button and a coin chute instead of a coin slide, and may be a repainted after-factory replacement. The schematic that came with the game is also pictured here and carries a part number found in Bally documentation assigned to Model 535. This schematic clearly shows it is a replay game with a replay counter. However, in the game pictured here, a portion of the backbox unit that searches for winning score combinations has been removed from the game, leaving clipped wires. This means no replays are ever awarded in spite of the score cards that were included with the game, and the knocker never operates. As a result, this particular game operates as a 5-ball novelty game, even while its inoperative replay unit remains visible to the player. It seems excessive to have physically deconstructed the search unit in this way when unsoldering wires would have been simpler and easily reversible, but perhaps it was necessary to show local authorities on demand that this game could never award replays. Reportedly, several of these games were operated in the Syracuse, New York area where replays were illegal. Perhaps the different coin door was necessary for New York operation. We don't know how many units of this Model 535 were made, and since the game pictured here reportedly is the only example that anyone has found, we do not know if other examples would have the unusual backbox insert modification. Even so, we have no reason to believe this modification and deeper backbox were not produced by Bally. The mirrored backglass is an original design and does carry the brand name. We suggest that any unauthorized party making a backglass would not have risked using the brand name or have bothered with the added expense of mirroring.Interestingly, although the schematic defends Broadway as a replay game, Bally's internal documentation identifies Model 535 as a \"5-ball novelty\" while clearly listing other machines of this type as \"bingo\". It is hard to know what Bally was thinking, when we find no ads placed by them, and the old Billboard ads we do find are minimal notices placed by distributors located in Los Angeles and other territories where replays were legal. The score cards imply a replay unit payoff, but could also be used in restricted territories to direct the location to pay off the player when law enforcement was not looking.Bright Lights and Broadway were Bally's first two bingo machines following a gap of many years since their very first one in 1937, Line-Up. Bally later made a different bingo game with the same name and a different backglass. See Bally's 1955 'Broadway'."

Operators of this period would soon retrofit flipperless games, like Broncho, and these new flippers often ended up in unusual places on the playfield.Of the several games pictured in this listing, three are itemized below to point out the playfield and cabinet art differences. We have numbered the images of these games to correspond with their descriptions:#1) Green and yellow playfield. The seven lettered bumper caps are green (or blue) and the three unlettered bumper caps are red (or pink). A red pop bumper and flippers were added after the game left the factory. The cabinet art looks repainted.#2) Orange and yellow playfield. The seven lettered bumper caps are orange. The three unlettered bumper caps are purplish. No after-factory modifications are apparent. The cabinet art looks factory-quality.#3) Another orange and yellow playfield. The seven lettered bumper caps are orange. On the lower playfield, the center bumper is purple while the bumpers on each side of it were replaced with red pop bumpers. Flippers were retrofitted as well, although the right flipper is missing and only its post hole is evident. The cabinet has been repainted.Setting aside the obvious after-factory modifications, both playfield color versions appear to be factory-quality. Unfortunately, we find only black-and-white advertisements from the manufacturer to assist our understanding of this.None of the cabinet art match the game in the Billboard ad. More examples of the cabinet are needed (or more 1940's ads) to study if multiple cabinet art designs could have been produced by the manufacturer. Although one or more of the cabinets presented here are repainted, we include them in this listing in order to anticipate any user questions about it, as we continue to gather additional information about this game."

Within each ring is a large diameter rubbered post of like color that does not spin, move, or score points, but does light up. There is a sixteenth spring bumper (yellow) at the bottom of the playfield.Pushing in the coin chute starts the game and lights up all bumpers. Pulling the chute back out leaves only the three center posts illuminated and all balls are then released to the ball lift mechanism. A ball hitting an unlit bumper scores 20 points. When the score reaches 760 points, the yellow ring of five bumpers will all light. Reaching 960 points will light the green ring of five, and reaching 1060 points will light the red ring of five. These bumpers will stay lit for the remainder of the game. The actual point thresholds to light these rings are operator adjustable. The sole yellow bumper at the bottom of the playfield can only be lit if a ball exits the playfield via the bottom rollover when the score is exactly 600 points. A ball hitting a lit bumper awards a replay on the backglass. The replays are displayed via silkscreened numbers that are not evident until lit, with numbers 1 to 9 on the left side, and numbers 10 through 70 on the right side. This makes for the possibility that a high number of replays can be awarded. A knockoff button on the right front of the cabinet bottom will subtract the replays down to zero, allowing for location payoffs. This game has a timer to shut off power to the entire machine even if a game is in progress."

		"features": "10 balls for 5 cents. Kick-out holes (3), Trap holes (17), Multiball play. The playfield glass is painted underneath with a design that complements the playfield layout, covering areas that are unused in game play. The upper playfield has three kick-out holes, five 500-point trap holes, a 1000-point trough, a 1500-point trough, and an outhole trough. It also has a right-side ball kicker lane and two left-side outlanes (one on each side of the 1500-point trough) to drop the ball to the lower playfield carousel. The carousel has trap holes around its perimeter and steps clockwise in response to upper playfield action. There is an outhole directly below it.A ball landing in the top \"Advance 1000 ball\" kick-out hole steps the carousel one position and kicks one ball out from the 1000-point trough, rolling it below the outball trough to the top hole of the carousel, worth 2000 points.A ball landing in the top \"Advance 1500 ball\" kick-out hole steps the carousel one position and kicks one ball out from the 1500-point trough, rolling it down the long left lane to loop around and land in the bottom hole of the carousel, worth 4500 points. If the top or bottom hole of the carousel is already occupied with a ball, the arriving ball will roll down towards either an outhole below the carousel, ending that ball in play, or fall into the return hole on the looping lane, allowing the player to shoot it again into play.A ball landing in the topmost kick-out hole returns all balls in the upper playfield outhole trough to the player to shoot again.The point values for the holes in the carousel do not move when the carousel moves. As the carousel steps, all balls trapped there step with it, increasing value up to 6500 points, but a ball worth 6500 points can step next to a 2000-point position to start all over.This game is designed to be multiball in the sense that a ball landing in a kick-out hole will be kicked back into play and simultaneously cause another ball to be kicked back into play from one of the upper playfield point troughs.'Builder Upper' was manufactured to be battery-operated, but one example pictured here has since been converted to line power. It has no apparent serial number, and its ball-lift mechanism is a knob on the right side of the cabinet, while the other game pictured here uses a front-loading push rod just below the plunger. No information is available to explain the reason for the two ball-lift versions, but manufacturers were known to make changes during production, sometimes based on operator feedback or because the original version had to be rushed to market."

Bally copied the idea from Pacent Novelty's 1936 'Bolo', a game that came out several months earlier. Bally did change the bumper design enough to obtain a patent on it.Patent No. 2,109,678 (\"CONTACT SWITCH FOR BALL ROLLING GAMES\") application was made on January 12, 1937 after the game was already in full production, and issued March 1, 1938 to Nils A. Nelson, a staff draftsman.According to interviews recorded in the  Encyclopedia of Pinball Vol 2, inventor Donald E. Hooker did the work of inventing the Bally bumper while Nils Nelson got the credit.In the January 1953 issue of Bally-Who, a monthly newsletter from Bally, this game was identified as the \"first spiral-wire bumper-type game\". That designation is not inaccurate, as Pacent's bumpers did not use spiral wires.'Bumper' used an electrical progressive score unit in the backbox which kept a running total using light projection. This was an improvement over previous pinball machines where the player had to add up the score by counting balls on the playfield. The new bumper allowed balls to exit the playfield after play while the score was maintained on the backbox.An earlier game having a mechanical progressive score unit is Gottlieb's 1934 'Register'.Patent No. 1,802,521 (\"GAME APPARATUS\") was filed Aug 14, 1928 and issued April 28, 1931 to George H. Miner."

Shown in this listing is a Sample game that did not have the up-post. The game has no serial number stamped on the cabinet or located anywhere else.

For that reason, on October 12, 1935, Kohler filed patent 2,070,948 and Shyvers filed patent 2,087,799 the same day. The two patents have identical drawings but non-identical text.By the time the first of the two patents, Koehler's, was approved in February 1937, pinball technology had evolved to render both Cannon Ball and Cannon Fire no longer viable, and Shyvers sold forty percent of his rights to Mr. B.P. Higby of Peoria, Illinois, a collector of patent rights. Due to the legal confusion surrounding ownership, the U.S. Patent Office issued a clarifying report in early 1937 that stated the kicker had a patent Application of August 1934 with a Reapplication in October 12, 1935, and was invented and patented by Frank Koehler of Portland, Oregon and assigned to Ken C. Shyvers of Chicago, Ill.Also produced as Shyvers Coin Automatic Machine Company's 1934 'Cannon Fire Jr.'."

The schematic part number for the US version is W-1042-31c, and for the German version is W-1042-33a.A Cash Box ad from February 18, 1967, indicates that Bally announced delivery of this game the week before, while the December 1966 date we show as Date of Manufacture came from a 1976 Bally parts catalog.Christian Jacobs, a collector in Germany, told us of a conversation he had in May 2000 with artist Jerry Kelley. In it, Kelley revealed that his inspiration for the art for 'Capersville' was the 1965 French detective movie 'Alphaville' starring American actor-singer Eddie Constantine. After looking at some old movie posters, it becomes obvious that Constantine is the man in the backglass."

		"notes": "'Capt. Fantastic' was inspired by the movie 'Tommy' and includes a representation of Elton John, as his character from the movie, playing pinball on the backglass. Tom Nieman, VP of Marketing for Bally Pinball, tells us the flyer was made while Elton was recording a new album in Canada. For this flyer, a game was shipped to the Toronto hotel where Elton was staying. That is why he is shown wearing a Canadian hockey jersey. Elton then asked Nieman to send a game to his various residences and one to his \"mum\" in the UK.Artist Dave Christensen included in the backglass several depictions of people doing things that, at first, escaped notice by Bally management. A small number of games with these so-called \"X-rated\" or \"uncensored\" backglasses made it through production before changes were required to be made. Specifically, small mirrored stars were added over the objectionable parts and, curiously, these stars did not effectively obscure the offending art in all instances. Nieman explained to us that he and Christensen wanted the correction to be as minimal as possible because they knew they had \"a monster hit\" on their hands. The X-rated version is often referred to as the \"no stars\" version even though all of the backglasses in the production run did contain a certain number of peripheral decorative stars anyway. Nieman is depicted in the backglass as the man in the three-piece suit, and he says that 'Brutus' is artist Paul Faris.Mr. Nieman attended the 1975 New York premier party for the movie \"Tommy\" held in the 57th Street subway station. He had agreed with artist Christensen to represent the date of this event in the backglass art as the score 31775. A biography of Keith Moon records the date of this party as March 18, 1975. It is easy to believe that the party extended over both days.Bally made an unknown quantity of playfields for this game having orange star rollover inserts instead of the usual green ones. This version is seldom seen, which indicates the quantity made was small. Pictured in this listing are three different examples of this \"orange version\" playfield. Two of the three also have a white drop target Special insert, instead of the expected red-colored one. The production run of this game was over 16,000 units, and these \"orange version\" playfields may have simply resulted from spot shortages during the production run of playfield parts having the correct colors. More information is needed to understand the reason for these playfield differences.The Early Production game pictured here has serial number 1088 and has green star rollover inserts on its playfield. It has the Over The Top backglass which is uncensored and, like the game in the flyer, its cabinet front has the \"reversed\" red and blue striping as compared to the striping on the cabinet sides.Included in this listing is a playfield showing signatures of both the designer and artist silkscreened in the black area at the bottom where the outlanes exit towards the outhole. Greg Kmiec tells us that Christensen had sneaked their signatures there but when Bally management heard about it and saw it, they made Christensen remove the signatures. Greg initially stated that only ten playfields were produced like this in a pilot run, not to appear on production games, but when the production game with serial number 1087 was identified as having a signed playfield, it caused him to wonder if a larger quantity of, say, 100 was actually made, to have appeared on production games. Another explanation would be that game 1087 was retrofitted with a pilot run playfield after it left the factory. We note that the game with serial number 1088 does not have a signed playfield.One game in this listing has a backbox frame painted red instead of the usual white. We have no further information on this except the same variation has been seen on Bally's 1978 'Power Play'.A home version of this game was also produced; see Bally's 1977 'Captain Fantastic & The Brown Dirt Cowboy'."

Unusually, the 'Approved' section for the designer's initials is crossed out and the name CARAVELLE appears instead of the designer's initials in what may be Kordek's writing. Also unusual is that there is no MASTER copy while the ORIGINAL has all of the usual tool room notations that would belong on the MASTER copy and shows completed \"Oct. 25 - 60\" (again showing the unusual dating style).Steve Kordek included this game on lists he would make of games that he designed but his name does not appear anywhere on the ORIGINAL drawing. Duncan Brown tells us that the scoring notations on this drawing show areas of Mabs' shaky handwriting but also Kordek's writing, and he adds:\"There is no way that Harry would be doing simple draftsman's work on a game for Steve [to approve as the designer]. Harry must have started the design. But just as clearly Steve was definitely involved in it too.\"Harry Mabs retired from Williams on 10-28-60, three days after the tool room work completed for Caravelle and prior to its production. His last game for which he is credited as the designer is Magic Clock from December, 1960.",

This first ball leaving playfield operates a \"Switch\" rollover which means all remaining balls will increase the score on the right side of backglass in 100-point increments. Replays are awarded for getting the right-side score to meet or beat the left-side score. In effect, the first ball sets the replay threshold for the remaining four balls. The 1000-point rollovers increase the right-side score by that amount with any ball in play, including the first one.To prevent a cheating player from shooting a second ball into play before the first ball has exited the playfield, the ball-lift mechanism has a contact on it to activate the \"Switch\" rollover if the player lifts a second ball prematurely.The single replay threshold will award either 2,3,4,5, or 10 replays.

Historian Sam Harvey�s handwritten notes credits three additional people as co-designers: Wayne Neyens, Bob Smith, and Tony Girardo. However, we found Patent 3,675,927 listing four inventors, Alvin Gottlieb, Wayne Neyens, Bob Smith, and Doc Garbark. We contacted Wayne Neyens, who had had the original concept for this game, and he explained how the game ended up being designed by committee, to his dismay:Tony GERARD was our superintendent, he was in charge of everything. Tony became ill and had to leave the company (he passed away shortly after) and Bob Smith became the superintendent and I became the Chief Engineer, We were very fortunate that Ed Krynski had joined the company and so he became the designer. I am not sure of the date that this all happened. It would sure help if I could come up with that date. Challenger must have been in the designing process for some time, I remember Bob, Alvin, Doc, and myself all arguing over the game, how that game ever got built I'll never know. I think Ed had very little if anything to do with Challenger, he was busy with designing our regular games. That period of time with Tony becoming Ill, Bob moving into his job, me moving into the engineering room and Ed coming on board was a very difficult time for all of us. No wonder there is so much confusion concerning the names on the Patent, etc. The earliest of our Gottlieb Engineering Game Cards shows Challenger was in the Engineering Department in August 1970 and by October 1970 had moved into production. Until we find information to support the retention of Krynski�s name as designer, Wayne agreed it is fair to remove Krynski�s name and replace it with the four names shown on the patent.  Patent 3,675,927 [TWO-PLAYER PINBALL MACHINE] filed June 10, 1970. Granted July 11, 1972 to Alvin J Gottlieb, Wayne E Neyens, Robert T Smith, and Roman F Garbark, Inventors."

A bell rings when the ball is shot to the high score area. No outhole on this game: two kickback lanes, in lower left and lower right of playfield, propel wayward balls back into scoring areas until they land in score pockets.This italicized information was taken from an advertisement:Chicago Express is the zipping, thrilling, most fascinating game in pin game history. Read carefully the ACTION the ball creates for the player:1. Player aims at and shoots ball into 1st top electric elevator, lighting up green go-ahead signal.2. Ball is elevated instantly and switched onto upper level tracks towards and into the 2nd or bottom electric elevator.3. As the ball in the 2nd elevator is being lifted and switched to next track, the whole train lights up and all the balls in the bottom Express Stations are automatically and simultaneously advanced into the next higher score stations.4. When a ball reaches the last Express Station, it is automatically shunted up the board and into the enclosed high score depot.Just imagine the novelty of seeing the balls elevated and sent down the tracks for a fast, thrilling ride.

This incongruity can be seen here.It seems improbable that a game would be delayed for two years. Yet, the two Billboard ads shown in this listing support a date of 1941 for 'Club Trophy' but, of course, do not mention a model number for it.A theory surfaces that a second, separate model of 'Club Trophy' had been produced in 1941 as shown in the Billboard ads and, if true, would remove these ads and the 1941 date from this Model 342 listing and thus resolve the date incongruity. This theory requires that Bally documentation be in error for some other model number, an idea not improbable.We know a Model 377 was assigned for a game named 'Trophy' which, by virtue of the model number, should have been produced in 1940. However, we have no Bally documentation or other evidence to indicate if that model was ever produced or was canceled. The Mead documents have no date for that model but instead refer the reader to a different model, Model 426, indicating only that it was produced 2-28-41 as 'Trophy'.We currently have no documentation or photographs to prove Model 426 was indeed produced in 1941 as 'Trophy'. According to the theory, if Model 426 was actually produced as 'Club Trophy' but was documented by Bally in error as 'Trophy', then our listing for Model 426 would be the correct place to host the two 1941 Billboard ads (along with a name correction to that listing). We would then have to believe that no game named 'Trophy' was made before the War. After the War, Bally made Model 498-A, 'Trophy' in 1948.See also Model 426, 'Trophy'. If anyone has documentation (manuals, schematics) for Bally's 'Trophy' or 'Club Trophy' to help us confirm/improve our dates for these games, or finds old advertisements or photographs that might help us identify if more than one version of either game was actually produced, please contact us."

		"notes": "Designer George Gomez tells us about his original design for this game and of changes that were made prior to production:At the time Williams was making wide bodies and so my design began as a widebody, but it didn't get very far. No widebody whitewoods were ever built. I originally designed the game with drop targets and the code for this is still in the game. The decals said B-2-K which was the Callaway Turbo option. A 4-Speed shifter was bolted to the side of the game and was used to shift gears in the dragstrip mode. That code also is still there. Some of the prototypes were built with these features and somewhere I have photos. Numerous prototypes were built with the shifters and also I retrofitted one onto a production game. Numerous switches (ramp ends), flashers, and lights were removed, along with the targets and shifter, to get the game within the bill of materials budgets.Pictured in this listing is an example of the so-called \"NCM\" games, made for the National Corvette Museum located in Bowling Green, Kentucky. We were unable to reach Tom Uban for input about them, but designer George Gomez provided this information:Museum games were very early production games. They were not prototypes. The playfield that you refer to in the image is one of the 17 prototype games, several of these playfields went to the museum for display purposes. However, museum games did have the special NCM welcome message in the code, this may have been the only difference in those games, other than that they were very early in the production run. I personally sold Chip Miller his game. At the time he was one of the key guys in the ZR1 registry and many of those guys bought games from us at the museum. I don�t remember the exact number of games that we took to the museum. I believe it was either 6 or 9. One went into the gift shop where I believe it still resides. I set up displays on the design of the game including drawings, the prototype playfields, and many other development items such as models within the museum. One was in the display cases at the base of the Spire, the other was in a hallway display case near the Corvette toys exhibit in the museum.During the grand opening weekend celebration the games were operated 24 hours a day at dollar play to benefit a charity. I worked the games with some of the other members of my team promoting and exposing people to the game. With me were Tom Kopera, mechanical engineer on the game; Bill Grupp, software engineer assisting Tom Uban; Roger Sharpe, director of licensing; and Barb Rosenthal, the Bally-Williams marketing director.If memory serves, I took 3 prototype playfields with me to the museum for the grand opening. The playfields were left in the care of the museum's curators. I was disappointed to learn that somehow they were let go from the museum's collection. Someone in Bowling Green ended up with one of them, he tells me that he bought it from a museum employee.",

		"notes": "A special version was produced for Germany with the same project number and project release date.  The schematic part number for the US version was W-1042-56a.  The German version was W-1042-57a.There were two different early production types using blue and/or black cabinet colors instead of the usual white production colors.  This can be seen in the flyer.The geometric cabinet design was used again on Bally's 1969 'On Beam' although the colors were changed.Included in this listing are three images from an owner who states they are from his German version of �Cosmos� with serial number 1638. One image shows the knocker coil assembly, mounted below the right flipper button, has no wires leading to it. Another image shows inside the backbox where the bell and coil are missing, and only the two drilled holes are visible in the cabinet wall for them, showing no evidence of use. The owner saw no factory wiring present in the game cabling for these two sound-making devices, and no loose or clipped wires to indicate a field removal had occurred. We contacted a long-time collector in Germany who confidently asserted that Germany had no laws or local ordinances prohibiting sound in pinball machines but that, according to a discussion he had had with an employee from L�wen-Automaten, the company that imported Bally machines at the time, operators simply didn't use the bells and so the pinball companies decided together that they could save costs by not shipping them. A collector in Austria whom we contacted has Gottlieb games from the 1970�s without the chime units in them, but all of his 1960�s Bally games do have their bells in the backbox, including his German versions.Neither of these collectors had heard of any laws ever prohibiting sound in pinball machines in Germany, a theory of which we had lightly heard but also for which we have received no supporting information. We welcome additional input on this topic."

He eventually discovered that the rejections were coming from Wesley Snipes, who wanted to ensure he did not look like a crazed character on the backglass because he was concerned about his upcoming career in Hollywood. Because of this, the final backglass is much simpler than early designs, and all three characters were given \"mathematically equal\" backglass coverage, with \"handsome\" features (according to Watson).Variations between playfields can be seen in the three round orange inserts near the car crash feature and also in the larger white rectangular insert to the left of them. The game in the flyer shows all four inserts are unlabeled. Other playfields pictured in this listing show the orange inserts are labeled 3, 6, and 10 Million and the white insert is labeled \"Retina Scan Ready\". One example shows the white insert is labeled while the orange ones are not.This game was part of Williams/Midway's \"SuperPin\" line of widebody games.",

All of the glasses pictured in this listing agree with the flyer. We don't have an example of the variant glass to show but we do have a close-up image we have labeled as the \"Crowd Scene\" showing the flyer art. Notice the hat in the woman's hand has its reflective sheen on its upper side and also the man behind her has a red striped shirt. In the variant glass, everyone in the scene looks different but the easiest differences to notice in the variant glass is that the hat has sheen on its bottom half and the man has no red stripes. It's possible there are differences elsewhere on the glass but we don't know. If anyone encounters this variant glass, please contact us and, if possible, photograph the cabinet serial number."

Keep in mind this was 1980 and they were still using Gordon Morrison as their primary artist. Gordon's work was friendly and accessible and he had been their signature artist for 20 years. I was the new guy they were trying out. Gottlieb still took pride in their 'family friendly' image, especially compared to what had been done by Dave Christensen at Bally in the 1970's. While I proceeded on to other projects, another artist at Ad Posters, Dave Moore, created a painting based on my design minus the naked green bat winged babes decorating the display windows. Dave's painting allowed Ad Posters to showcase their new 4 color process on glass printing capability."

The name of the game is written on the woman�s top. The two white rollover buttons on the lower playfield, one in front of each slingshot, are marked as scoring 10 points. The two white inserts for the Doodle Bug Scores, located above the flippers, are marked for 1 point and 10 points. Production games have 5-digit scoring which extended the Player 1 score reels into the area of the woman�s top, likely the reason the game name was moved on the production games to the lower right corner of the backglass. The rollover buttons were changed to score 100 points, and the two Doodle Bug Score inserts were changed to indicate 10 points and 100 points.Pictured in this listing is a backbox with a 4-digit backglass thus indicating that some quantity of the 4-digit scoring games were actually produced. No serial number was provided to us but we have marked this image as Early Production. This particular backbox was attached to a lower cabinet having artwork for 5-digit scoring and, reportedly, this \"mismatch\" of backbox and lower cabinet appeared to score properly (assuming a dummy 1's digit). On a normal 5-digit production game, the extra ball light illuminates randomly via the match unit which steps during the game. The flyer seems to indicate that on the 4-digit game the extra ball is controlled by advancing the target lights. On this Early Production game with its apparent \"mismatched\" backbox and lower cabinet, it was reported to us that the owner had to add some additional circuitry to get the extra ball feature to work. This strongly indicates that the game did not leave the factory as a malfunctioning \"mismatched\" game. Interestingly, our Promotional Photo of the 5-digit game shows a playfield marked for 4-digit scoring. Games used for promo photos often were temporarily assembled just to get the photos made and did not have to operate nor were considered a final assembly."

		"notes": "We had understood from a Bally employee at a past Expo seminar that this game license had been a difficult one because singer Dolly Parton kept changing her mind about how she should be portrayed on the backglass, due to her crossover status at the time from country to pop. The Early Production cabinet side art in this listing depicts a bouffant-haired Dolly playing a guitar while the rest of the production run cabinets omit this image, making us wonder if this depiction had been rejected by the singer. Indeed, the flyer shows the singer standing next to the machine with a hairstyle more in line with her backglass portrayal than with the bouffant style that was removed from the cabinet. Believing it was Paul Faris who had spoken at that Expo, we asked him to comment for this listing. He replies:With Dolly Parton, we did have to change the backglass artwork from a country theme to a more crossover mainstream look on the backglass art only. Since the playfield was completed, they (she) agreed to let it stay \"Country\" in her denim outfit. I honestly don't remember the cabinet [with her image on it] but it is possible that was an early sample of a cabinet that was later used. The artwork sequence was usually: Backglass concept first (for approvals), then production art on the  cabinet, playfield and plastics, and finally the finished backglass art. It is possible that the [cabinet with her image] was a cabinet done BEFORE the backglass art changed and the version [without her image] was another concession to her crossover look and used for production. Different sample color cabinets was not unusual before a final version was determined."

The 100,000 digit is a silkscreened \"1\" that is lit from behind when earned. The playfield has a light red background with a dark red circle at each outlane and under the pop bumpers.The backbox pictured in the manufacturer's flyer has an actual score reel for the 100,000 position, as evidenced by the part number visible just underneath the \"1\" on the reel. This game has five actual score reels plus one dummy reel. Its playfield art is the light red background with the dark red circles. Pictured in this listing is a production game from France with an actual score reel in the 100,000 position, just like the flyer game. It has a silkscreened 1,000,000 light in place of the words \"Over The Top\" although the bulb sockets to light it were not fully wired by the factory. There are no match numbers on the glass or on the backbox insert. The playfield is pink and has large circles in a light shade of purple at the outlanes and under the pop bumpers. The cabinet has serial number 65420 and its pink color has faded white. We believe this game to be Early Production and have marked it as such. An operator later added a yellow rollover button to its playfield to help advance the 1-2-3-4 target sequence. The current owner added a large bell and knocker as there were none, and replaced some 1970's Gottlieb-style pop bumper caps with ones similar to what was used in production. No paperwork accompanied this game except for its Instruction Card and Score Card shown here. We show additional playfield pictures of the same game shot with a different camera showing darker shades of color, but the owner confirms the playfield is actually pink with light purple circles."

Dalek backbox topper lights up (and its head moves from side to side on some games. See Notes below).The two flippers at the bottom of the playfield are slightly shorter than Williams' standard-size flippers. This was a change implemented by Williams management to hopefully shorten game time and increase earnings. These shorter flippers have a lightning bolt design embossed on the top of them.We received a report of a game with \"serial number 31\" identified as a prototype game and having a different decal under the right side ramp entrance than other games. Unfortunately, the submitter didn't include an email address so we have no way of confirming this information.",
		"notes": "Designer Bill Pfutzenreuter told us that about a dozen (or less) sample games were made, followed by approximately 100 prototype games, before regular production began. Up to this point in manufacture, the Dalek head in the backbox topper moved from side to side. As a cost saving measure, once regular production began, the motor and front-facing opto for this movement were removed, resulting in the Dalek head being stationary (non-moving) on production games. The wiring and software for this feature was left intact, and this has allowed game owners to reinstall the missing components, either by purchasing after-market kits or by purchasing the components individually, to again make the Dalek head move from side to side.We asked Pfutz if he was aware of a way for new owners of this game to discern if their moving Dalek head came from the factory that way or was retrofitted. He said that Williams had glued the stationary Dalek head onto the body, therefore the kits had to \"unglue\" or cut the head off, and that it was complained that Williams had used too much glue. Thus, perhaps one could look for any irregular cuts or glue remnants. If anyone knows of additional ways to positively identify retrofits, please contact us.",

This provides the experience of solid state scoring and response, with the added nostalgia of Electro-mechanical chimes. The BONUS BALLS in the centre of the lower playfield are designated balls 1-7 for Players 1 & 3, balls 9-15 for Players 2 & 4.Artist Margaret Hudson, who assisted Paul Faris on this game as a learning experience, says those are her initials on the bracelet of the girl in the backglass.Two of the light shields are unusual as they have a second screening of red on top of the normal screening.  This causes an effect similar used on the \"Phantom of the Opera\" glass, though no one probably would ever normally notice.  For instance, \"Pinky Tuscadero's\" shirt on the slingshot plastic appears red when the game is on, and tan when it's off.Pictured in this listing is an Early Production game with serial number EEB1109 located in Germany. The backglass does not lift up and out of the game but remains in its wood frame which hinges outward. The key lock for it is positioned lower on the backbox side than it is for later production backboxes which do not hinge."

Cufflinks with identical initials are also found on the backglasses of Williams' 1971 'Planets' and Williams' 1971 'Zodiac'.",
		"notes": "The 1988 book Pinball The Lure of the Silver Ball states that a \"split bank\" was invented by Norm Clark for '8 Ball' and reused again on Williams' 1971 'Solids N Stripes'. This so-called \"split bank\" is a term that has since been associated with this game and was a reference to the fact that each player's earned billiard balls are retained on the backglass and playfield as a ball-to-ball carry-over feature. If the term was ever intended to describe the mechanisms by which this feature is accomplished, it misleads. Actually, a standard step-up unit is used for each player to count the billiard balls earned by that player. A standard Player Relay alternates between players to select which of the two playfield step-up units is active for the player who is being served, no differently than how the Player Relay selects for any multi-player game which set of backbox score reels is active for the player who is being served. In this way, the Player Relay in an EM pinball machine simply allows stepping mechanisms that are dedicated to a player to continue from where they last left off for that player. Strictly speaking, all backbox score reels are ball-to-ball \"carry-over\" and therefore all multi-player EM games have \"memory\" at least for the backbox. The Player Relay and its multi-player function was in use since the 1950s so whatever Norm Clark had 'invented' for '8 Ball' in 1966 was likely only Williams' ability to say it is their first application of the Player Relay to provide \"memory\" for a feature that is on the playfield. Even so, we do not know the source of any claim that Williams was first with that idea, and for this game. Norm Clark had begun designing games only four years earlier, starting with Williams' 1962 'King Pin', so it's possible that playfield \"memory\" on a multi-player EM pinball machine existed on Williams games prior to 1962 or on games from other manufacturers prior to '8 Ball'. If anyone can provide an example of an earlier game, please let us know.Another early Williams multi-player EM game that had playfield 'memory' using alternating step up units is Williams' 1968 'Pit Stop'."

If the player chooses to play off these games won, these score reels do not subtract. Instead, with each press of the replay button, three other score reels (called Sub-Total) increment to count the games played off. If the player chooses to cash out, the location would subtract the Sub-Total from the Total Score and pay the difference, one dime for each point.At the top of the backglass are bulb scores to exceed 900 points.

One is missing its backbox. Neither have cabinet art that match the game in the manufacturer's Billboard ad. Interestingly, one cabinet does match the artwork of a game pictured for Chicago Coin's 1938 'Peppy' but neither of them match the cabinet art of the manufacturer's Billboard ad for that game either.We asked the owner to determine how long the playfield lamps light up for increased point value. His games, located in the UK, have a 240v transformer and the closest he could get to 110-120v was to middle-tap the motor at 127v. At that setting, the motor turned to light the lamps for less than a second, with four-second intervals between illuminations. It is assumed that the motor is under the control of a bell-timer that shuts the game off after a specified time, but the two games shown here each had no bell-timer, with two screw holes and some cut wires where the bell timer would be."

		"notes": "This game has no replay unit or add-a-ball unit. While its apron is similar to add-a-ball games made for export to Italy, Federico Croci, a collector in Italy, tells us that he has never seen this game there. He also provides these studied observations:1) Italian versions did not use printing such as \"insert coin only when coin entrance is lit\", or \"credit when lit\" around the credit light. The word 'credit' was forbidden on games in Italy. 2) Italian add-a-ball games typically have five similar objects in the art of the backglass to count added balls, but they are not present here, and there is no stepping unit shown in the backbox picture to count added balls.3) This game has a four-digit score which is quite low for a 1971 Italian-version game. Operators in Italy by this time were modifying old four-digit games into five digit games, and newly built games for Italy were coming out with 5 digits. 4) Gottlieb's factory address was never included in full in the playfield or in the backglass in the export games. Here, it is displayed on the apron.Reportedly, this game was made for New York in light of its restrictive laws regarding pinball at the time, in the fashion of Gottlieb's 1971 'Bristol Hills'. It was produced just after Gottlieb's 1971 'Playball' and had a playfield quite similar except without pop bumpers. The fact of its Novelty Play format, its lack of pop bumpers, the apron not having the word 'flipper', and the backglass indicating only 'Innings' instead of 'Ball In Play' may have been attempts to downplay or differentiate this game from contemporary pinball machines."

		"notes": "This game has two 7-digit alphanumeric score displays and two 7-digit numeric-only score displays.Designer Steve Ritchie tells us that there were 10 prototype games made. He also says that, while the X in the serial number means \"prototype\", this was not used consistently at Williams. One of these games is pictured in this listing with serial number 554-X 94222. The cabinet art design was deemed too plain and was changed for production. The clear flash lamp domes along the back wall of the playfield were too blinding during play, and all were later changed to a red color. The beacons on top of the backbox also were too bright and so their domes were later changed.Included in this listing is a close-up image of a production game having the clear flash lamp domes that were used on the prototypes. This game has the production cabinet artwork. Its backbox beacons look to be the production ones. Reportedly, Early Production models still used the clear domes, but its later serial number of 554 198595 conflicts with that idea.Another later serial number of 554 196508 belongs to a game having prototype MPU ROMs labeled 'PROTO5'. For this reason we have marked as a Prototype Game the two images we have of it. The owner states its sound and speech ROMs have red labels/stickers the same as production ROMs of his other games. It has the clear flash lamp domes at the rear of playfield as well as the clear backbox beacons.Another game pictured here has serial number 554 95836 and has the clear beacons and extra flash lamps like a prototype, but has production cabinet art. The board ROMs are Version 1. The speaker grills have no \"W\" or any evidence of red paint. The speaker panel itself is attached to the backbox with adhesive instead of being held by an H-shaped support strip. The strip on this game is U-shaped to hold only the backglass above it. Unique to this game is that all the flash lamps have insulation around them. We use the low serial number to classify this example as Early Production. One other such game was discussed on a pinball newsgroup as having the glued speaker panel and the insulated flash lamps, but its speaker grills did have the \"W\" painted on them.Based on the above examples and their serial numbers, we do not know how to expect which games in the run would be the 10 prototypes of which Steve Ritchie is aware. Because game owners can easily replace their flash domes and beacons with clear versions, this can further the uncertainty.Later playfields in the run had their two flashers disabled and removed because bending targets caused electrical shorts which then damaged the switch matrix. The clear flash domes on these playfields were replaced with red ones.According to Steve Ritchie's website, he and his brother Mark Ritchie were the voice talent for this game.Comments from designer Steve Ritchie:F-14 had a first-ever kickback device that fired the ball straight back at the flippers at very high speed, called the Jagov Kicker. F-14 was the first game with \"Autosave\", which meant the player could have the ball back if it drained prematurely [at the start of a ball], was shot down between the flippers by the Jagov Kicker, or drained during the onset of multiball, etc.We received from a collector in the UK some observations about apparent production run changes. This information has not been confirmed by us:1) The early games had the audio PCB of the time, '-11298'. This was changed during the run to '-11581' which continued in use until the WPC system came out.2) There seem to have been three different display PCB's used during the run. The earliest is as used on Millionaire with lamp matrix connections and holes for lamp twist bases but omitting the credit display and its drive components. The second type omitted the unused PCB traces, but remained the same size. These two are larger than the final type, which became the standard used until the 16-digit displays were introduced with Taxi.",

		"notes": "According to the Encyclopedia of Pinball Volume 2, the playfield design of this game was influenced by Williams' 1976 'Grand Prix'.The manufacturer's flyer shows a playfield with all standup targets being red in color and round in shape. Of the several playfields pictured in this listing, only one playfield (from France) matches the flyer game in this way. Of the remaining examples, all but one use the round red targets to advance only the red bonus, with round green targets to advance the green bonus, and a round yellow target to change the bonus selection. These several matching playfields suggest a target change occurred during production and after the flyer was made. All playfields discussed in this paragraph have red posts.The remaining playfield has all square yellow targets and its bumpers caps do not have the red circles as do the flyer game and the other playfields. What is interesting about this example is that all but one of its light shields have a unique color scheme, not explained by red fade. All posts are white, not red. Additionally, the playfield area under the right spinning target shows an original value of �10,000 W/L�  but was covered with an appliqu� reducing the value to 1,000 points. Since the game in the flyer also shows 1,000 points for this spinner (and may or may not have this appliqu�), it appears that this playfield could be a prototype or Early Production version. Under the apron, the number �011� is stamped, but its significance is unknown to us. The backbox has serial number 471, a number that we would expect of a game made well into the production run. It�s possible the playfield did not start out in its cabinet."

First electronic multiball. First animated displays.Prototype versions feature two 3-bank drop targets. They were replaced by the standup targets in the production version.",
		"notes": "For several Williams games (especially before 1987), Speech Processing was a separate task than Software Programming and may have been done by a different person than whom we list as having done the Software. Paul Dussault did the Speech Processing for this game.Eugene Jarvis told us that the background sound for Firepower, and all the other sounds for Firepower, were his own design.There is an excellent Firepower website at http://www.firepowerpinball.com/Reportedly, the only differences between the L2 and L6 software are the price presets 1, 2, and 3, and the number of maximum credits.We asked Steve Ritchie about the first instance of the Lane Change feature, and if other pinball machines at that time might have had similar lane-changing except controlled by a CPU instead of a flipper button. He replies:FP was the first.  One night I asked Eugene Jarvis if he could \"move an unlit light under a ball coming down the lane with the right flipper switch.\"  He said, \"yes\", and built the code.  That same night at Williams we were using Lane Change.  No CPU was changing lanes at the time either.He also puts to rest any belief that Williams' 1980 'Blackout' was the first game with Lane Change simply because its model number 495 preceded Firepower's number 497:Blackout was manufactured and designed WELL after Firepower. Williams produced many games out of model number order.Steve comments about the prototype version:The first 10 games we built had 2 3-banks of drops in place of the standups.  They were so crappy that they were making the game unreliable, so we went with the standups for production.  It was a smart move.  If we had good drop targets it would have sold 20,000, but it wasn't working long enough to earn anything with the bad drops....Pictured in this listing is a cabinet having a bottom panel design resembling a brick wall. We do not know how many came from the factory with this \"brick bottom\". Steve comments about this and about another idea considered for cabinet construction:Williams often made 2 sets of stencils for 2 different cabinet companies many times. We were selling so many pinball machines that we required at least 2 if not 3 \"wood butchers\" to keep up with demand, and they were Electronic Sound, Churchill Cabinet, and sometimes Lenk-Smith. There may have been others as well. I seem to remember that we got the brick pattern Masonite for cabinet bottoms because of a production shortage of un-printed Masonite. The tacky brick pattern stuff was popular for paneling basements. Williams probably paid less for the printed stuff, and it was probably all that could be had at the time. Particle board (MDF) was experimented with on pinball cabinets, and a few were built with disastrous effects. This was due to wishful thinking on the part of some \"new guy\" engineers and greed on the part of Williams' management.A group of us condemned the concept because we knew that there was no hope of making an MDF cabinet that would be as durable (and light!!..operators hated the already-heavy pinball machine becoming obese, and the increased shipping weight and $$) as plywood.The \"brick bottom\" shows up on a game from another manufacturer: Stern's 1980 'Seawitch'A machine with an ornate design on its bottom has been found and is pictured in this listing."

That changing background added a tension and excitement that was never present in earlier games. That sound also broadcasted how well the player was doing.  If you heard the only game that made a background sound in an arcade at high pitch and a fast cycle, all eyes were on you, sometimes gathering a small crowd in those days.The production run of this game was far higher than previous Williams games. Steve Ritchie comments:Towards the end of the run of Flash, I asked Jack Mittel, then-VP of sales, why we wouldn't try to push past the 20,000 unit mark. He replied, \"We want to leave the market wanting.\"Steve also tells us about the prototype backglass shown in this listing:We printed two backglasses in a blue background because management was scared that the black background wouldn't be accepted. We also printed two red ones. I owned them all, but both reds and one blue disintegrated as I unwrapped them after being in storage for 34 years. The ink was in a pile at the bottom of the package!No games were sent out with any color other than black background, which was widely accepted and dramatic when lit \"back in the day.\"Reportedly, later production units had System 6 CPU boards.Steve tells us that a subsequent game \"Super Flash\" was contemplated in 1986 as a 'sequel' but never made it as far as the drawing board."

(Bally's 1979 'Kiss' prototype was the first, but the production game did not contain speech. Bally's 1980 'Xenon' was the first production Bally game with speech.)Per Claude Fernandez and Kevin O'Connor at Chicago Expo 2014, customers complained about the strobe light in the upper backbox so it was removed during production. The small clear window through which the strobe had flashed was covered over.Some games were equipped in the backbox with a \"Vocalizer\" Module (AS-2518-57) and a \"Sounds Plus\" Module (AS-2518-56). Reportedly, these were Early Production games and that, during production, these modules were replaced by a single \"Squawk & Talk\" Module (AS-2518-61). If you have the correct manual for your game, the diagram on page 10 will agree with the module(s) in your backbox. Flash Gordon started as a 1930's comic strip hero and was a very successful Hollywood motion picture serial in 1936, prompting two more serials in 1938 and 1940. A movie in 1980 coincided with the production of this game.An earlier game that has 2-way kick-out holes is Gottlieb's 1950 'Rockettes'.",

One has a yellow-and-black card holder and the other has a red one. Although the flyer game has a blue Double Bonus Insert, these Early Production games have a red insert. The owner of one of the games told us this red insert later broke so he replaced it with a blue one to match the color in the flyer. On production games, this insert is green.One unusual example of this game is shown here and has green flip flags. It had white mushroom bumpers until they were replaced with yellow ones by the owner. Unlike the flyer game, the backbox is factory-mounted upside down (flip-flopped?) onto the main cabinet. There is no serial number stamped anywhere on the cabinet or backbox. Inside the backbox is a paper tag with number 6527. If that is the serial number, then it exceeds the number of games in the Production Run, as the last number in the run is expected to be 6350. However, to label this game as Later Production based on the paper tag seems incongruous with the green flags and white mushroom bumpers expected of Early Production games. J.P. Poelzer, a collector in Seattle, tells us that the Seattle Center was a test location for Bally back in the 1970s as he personally saw many Bally games put out for test play before they were actually released. Until we have more information, the fact that he obtained this unusual game from that location and that it has no serial number causes us to identify his game as a prototype.For another game with green flip flags and inverted backbox, see the low-production Bally's 1976 'Slap Stick'."

		"notes": "'Flipper' was the first add-a-ball machine and introduced the concept of extended play. Until this game was made, David Gottlieb was of the firm opinion that \"Nothing will replace the Free play as a game attraction\". In fact, prior to this game he had halted an extended play concept for which he was unsatisfied, under development as Gottlieb's 1960 'Dancing Dolls (Prototype)'. Alvin Gottlieb tells us that his father's attitude changed upon playing 'Flipper': After he played Wayne�s first finished production model, he decided to try to get it approved in some foreign markets where a \"Free Play\" was considered a \"Thing of Value\" that made it a part of gambling. Suren Fesjian�s Mondial Company managed to get it approved in France and Italy, and the rest is history.Gottlieb's changeover from cabinets having wood side rails and square backboxes to cabinets having metal side rails and wedge head backboxes occurred during production of this game. Reportedly, the first 415 units were manufactured as woodrails and the remaining 685 units as wedge heads. These numbers have not been confirmed to us. Included in this listing are two examples of this woodrail cabinet. One is marked 'Sample Game' because of its serial number while the other is marked 'Early Production' because we do not know its serial number. The Sample game has cabinet art that was not used on the production games, nor have we seen it in any other production run in a search of years 1950-1965. A close comparison showed up in the lower cabinet art of Gottlieb's 1963 'Square Head'.The woodrail version was the last game to have Gottlieb's famous phrase on the backglass: Amusement Pinballs, as American as Baseball and Hot Dogs! The first game to have it was Gottlieb's 1955 'Marathon'. The phrase did not appear on the wedgehead version nor on later games.Wayne Neyens tells us why Gottlieb began using the wedge head design:When the flipper games came on location we soon heard complaints about side by side games. It was hard to keep the games in line and separated so that there was room for two pairs of hands. Well the four player solved the problem, the lite box did the job of separation. The answer became obvious, we needed to increase the size of the lite box on single player games. I believe that Doc [Roman F. \"Doc\" Garbark, head of mechanical engineering at Gottlieb] came up with the WEDGE HEAD design. It was cheaper for us to spend a little more money on the cabinet than to buy a larger glass, more art work, and screens, etc. Also, it was a new look, a win win deal for us. I don't know who hung the name WEDGE HEAD on the design but it is very descriptive.This wedge head backbox came out thirteen years after the debut of the EM flipper, and we do not know why the complaints were seemingly endured by Gottlieb (and, presumably, by the pinball industry) for that length of time before a solution was at hand. We have not found a pinball game prior to 1960 that has a wedge head backbox, although we believe many European pinball games for this time frame have yet to be documented."

It differs from the production game as follows:� The backglass \"Game Over\" indicator is invisible until illuminated from behind.� The backglass words \"Balls To Play\" do not have lamps wired to illuminate them, nor holes drilled for lamp sockets. Accordingly, the Balls To Play Unit in the backbox does not have the wiper finger or contact points for those lamps.� The backbox connects to the lower cabinet using a 12-pin connector, instead of a 10-pin connector.� The lower cabinet motor board has unterminated wires stapled to the wood, for a relay not installed.� The wood strips inside the lower cabinet that support a raised playfield are one long piece on each side instead of two pieces on each side.� The lamp sockets for the center orange and green inserts are individually mounted to the underside of the playfield instead of mounted on a common metal plate.� The cardholder artwork is red and purple instead of red and blue."

Programmer Orin Day tells us about the use of 6-players in Sega games:The 6-player display code was prototyped as a \"proof-in-concept\" on the Frankenstein display, but was first released in Baywatch. The Frankenstein multiball start display effect was repurposed in attract mode to promote this 6-player feature. Baywatch and Batman Forever also had this feature. When we switched back to the 128x32 display for Apollo 13 and subsequent games we also switched to the Whitestar hardware system.  It's my recollection that at that time we coded both the game and display to take six players. It was removed from the system at the time of Sharkey's Shootout, no games after that had it (with the exception of NFL, which was a derivative of Striker, and any games from earlier in the catalog like South Park which were remanufactured).",

		"notes": "Ed Boon is the voice of Rudy.According to Brian Eddy, he did not do work on the sound for this game as is sometimes stated.  He stated at Expo 2004 that he did only display effects and some flasher effects for this game.Reportedly, about 200 of the first playfields made were manufactured with \"Diamond Plate\" covering.  Additionally, several years later and due to dwindling replacement stock, a set of NOS replacement playfields was manufactured which also had the Diamond Plate covering, although these are also reported to suffer from having the red color 'bleed' around the center playfield clock.Also, early production models of Funhouse have the Williams System 11 sound board (part no. D-11581) hooked up to the WPC board (via an adapter), because the WPC sound board wasn't yet ready for distribution.Larry DeMar shares with us some of the design efforts:There was a mechanical clock created for Fun House.  However it was a verydifferent design than the clock which was used in Twilight Zone.Cost was one of the issues that led to the removal of the mechanical clock but the initial design which used two solenoid-operated stepper wheels rather than an electric motor was not reliable and Pat was uncomfortable with getting it fixed in the time frame we had to finish the game.  So John Krutsch started work on the later design which was finally used in Twilight Zone.Rudy \"names\" each player and addresses that player by their name. Most interesting in a multi-player game but in my opinion a feature that we put a lot of effort into which had very little impact on the quality of the game (most people just didn't notice).The concept of [naming one of the players] \"Slick\" was that Rudy didn't like you and was picking on you, which we thought would cause buddies to rib each other in multi-player games but no one noticed this either besides discovering certain \"rare\" phrases like \"zooooooooooooooooooooom\"!Matt Walsh comments further:Light inserts on the lower playfield take the place of the clock's functionality.Each player who starts a game of Funhouse is given a name...like Chucky, Spunky, Bucko, and Slick. That name sticks for your player for each ball. It's not that obvious; I'm sure many people don't even notice that. Originally, the idea was that each of those names was to have it's own 'personality' such that Rudy would use varying phrases for each person. But all that remains of this feature is that some of Rudy's phrases will have the player's name inserted in. Well almost.  If the player receives the name \"Slick\" - which is only possible in a two or more player game - the semi-derisive phrases will be used.In this listing are two close-up images of the Diamond Plate logo. One shows a playfield part number of 31-1605-SP while the other one shows 31-1607. Pat Lawlor explains why this is so:Funhouse playfields have a wide variety of part #'s and designations on them, both depending on when they were made in the run, and the vendor making them. VERY early prototype playfields have NO part # on them at all and do not say Diamond Plate. There ARE playfields that say \" Protected by LS topcoat\" since Lenc Smith did not use the Diamond Plate name. Williams had a problem with all of their vendors and keeping them straight. 31-1605-SP is an early Sun process playfield. 31-1607 is a later MULTI-vendor designation. Later, the only way to tell who made the playfield was to look at the edge of the playfield wood and check the marker designations. Adding to this confusion is that playfields could have been stored and then used early or later in the run, AND part sales playfields could have been done at almost any time in the run. What does this mean? Williams was worried that they needed to track the different vendors playfields in case of early wear out problems. So the odd part numbers were a way to try and track the vendors. It is simply a reflection of how many vendors were needed to keep the assembly line running on a daily basis.The manufacturer's flyer shows a playfield with five targets spelling S-T-E-P-S instead of the production games that have only four targets spelling S-T-E-P. In fact, in the flyer, the \"P\" standup target is missing and all one sees in its place is the small square hole in the playfield where the target should be. In addition, the makeup on Rudy's face is different. The five triangular bonus inserts near the flippers each do not have the words \"Gang Way\" on them. A fuller comparison of a prototype version to the production version can be found here.Williams used this game theme once before on Williams' 1956 'Fun House' which had three trap doors.A game with two talking heads is Williams' 1994 'Red & Ted's Road Show'.",

If this relay was not installed, a shorting plug was necessary in that jack to provide for replay operation.The schematic diagram makes dotted-line reference to the Extra Ball Relay at locations F-7 and F-15. Two earlier Williams games which have this optional relay are 1965�s Big Chief and 1967�s Shangri-La.The Sample playfield shown in this listing has the light blue upper apron and wood rails, as does the game in the flyer.

Unless otherwise noted, the playfield images shown here are of the first version.  Notable differences are as follows:1. First version was not diamond coated2. Art work on playfield for the 1st, 2nd, etc. \"gear lights\" is yellow in the first version, and fluorescent orange with the word \"gear\" added on later versions.  e.g.: \"1st Gear\" vs \"1st\".   Also, the first version has the words \"Supercharger\" in front of the super charger entrance.3. Front cabinet decal on first version is of the head lights of the car on the backglass.  This was changed on the later version and the word \"Getaway\" was added under coin door.4. First version has single playfield hinge, not allowing playfield to be pulled forward for servicing.  Switches and brackets were also moved on later versions to suit later style playfield hinge system.  The early version also has 2 extra GE lights on the right side of the playfield, but they were removed to fit the new hinge system.5. First version used a standard 23/850 coil and bell amature assembly for the ball launcher; later version used a much larger, more powerfull assembly.6. Added ball deflector to rear glass channel on later versions to prevent air balls from falling into cabinet (Top left corner).7. Bar code added to left return lane under diamond coat on later version-----This game is renowned for blowing U20 on the MPU board.  This is caused by balls getting stuck under slingshots, which can smash the bulb, shorting the bulb filament to the sling switch and instantly blowing U20.   If you have a switch matrix problem that says \"Ground Short\" check under your slings for a lodged ball. If checking for voltage to \"Mars Lamp\" Red rotating light, the manual states 48VAC but the correct voltage is 20VAC.-----Included in this listing are pictures of a prototype \"mountain\" that was not installed on production games. Reportedly, there were only twenty formed, with six of them cut and fitted for the game. Steve Ritchie comments: \"The vacuform \"mountain / tunnel\" was deleted from the design as a cost reduction.  Only a few were painted, and that was where the big cost savings came in.  [The reported] quantity numbers sound right, but it was a long time ago.\"",

The upper playfield art shows the name 'Ginger' inside a large inverted triangle. Inexplicably, prior and subsequent issues of this Billboard ad show the single habitrail version as pictured in this listing.It would appear that the 10-ball two-habitrail game was built first then was updated to the 8-ball single habitrail version with three more kickers and more sophisticated artwork, even though the text for the ads was not updated and continued to refer to a quantity of \"6 kickers\" and, in the case of one ad (not shown here), still indicated the game was 10-ball play.Both versions were advertised with the coin slide positioned to the left of the coin door. We note the game pictured here has the coin slide on the coin door itself with the coin view window and tilt cup having changed places. The metal baffle under the playfield shows the mechanical bar for the coin slide to press against and the one that resets the tilt cup do not look modified, indicating it came from the factory like this.If anyone has access to the \"dual habitrail\" version of this game to make photographs and/or can provide manufacturer documentation for either version, please contact us."

Letters are very carefully drawn in a very shaky hand. I�m beginning to think his exit from Williams the following year was from age or other medical issues.

Kordek likely held the role of electrical circuit designer while Heiss designed the physical playfield.A schematic diagram for Genco's 1952 'Jumpin' Jacks' from Steve Kordek's files was found with handwritten changes made in pencil. This changed schematic exactly matches the schematic for Golden Nugget so we have placed it in this listing as a \"preliminary version\" and show it in grayscale to allow the pencilling to be visible. The name on this schematic is handwritten as \"Show Boat\" and probably was changed for this February 1953 game once it was seen on United's December 1952 'Show Boat'."

It reports that Grand Slam debuted at the Amusement Operator's Expo the previous month which was March 25-27, 1983 at the O�Hare Exposition Center in Chicago. The text reads \"Grand Slam can take on 2 or 4 players, When the 4-Player option is used, the readout shows the 1st and 2nd players' runs while they play and flashes the runs for the 3rd and 4th players when it's their turn at bat.\" The accompanying photo shows the 4-player game.Tim Arnold told us that this game was originally a 2-player but they were not selling well so Bally made the last part of the production run as 4-player (backglass has four score windows for the four score displays). We show only a single production run quantity of 1000 units which likely includes both 2-player and 4-player quantities. We note that a single Model Number 1311 represents both versions. Tim said this game was made in the Midway plant using the Midway serial numbering system which starts at the number 1. For instance, serial number 124 is the 124th game produced. If Tim�s information is correct, then eventually having enough serial numbers in evidence should be useful to determine when during the production run the games converted from having only 2 score displays to having 4 displays.The only Installation Manual that we have contains a backbox wiring diagram showing pinouts for \"optional\" Player 3 and Player 4 connectors. (We present it in this 4-player listing.) If we assume that Bally/Midway did not know sales of the 2-player version would be so poor, to have pre-printed for each 2-player game a manual that would contain these optional pinouts, then perhaps two versions of this manual exist. If anyone has an original Grand Slam manual or backbox wiring diagram that does not evidence a third or fourth player, please contact us. The Installation Manual indicates the MPU is AS-2518-133.Bally made a set of six baseball cards for Grand Slam (not shown here) as a promotional item and the set we saw pictured only the 4-player backglass. Reportedly, these cards were given away at the Bally booth at a 1983 spring coin-op games trade show. If we can identify which trade show this was, and the days it occurred, this might contribute to our understanding of the evolution of this game."

Pro Football was the only game that ever injured me. The story:Since the game was in early production, there was one or two set up in the showroom at Gottlieb. Sometimes after lunch we'd go play these games. What I hated about Pro Football was that the ball could go out the side rollover while the motor was still running because of other scoring. The outlane rollover was very important --- it completed the football \"run\" across the playfield and gave a touchdown score. I am not much of a game pusher or tilter, but I got so frustrated from losing the outlane rollover score that I actually kicked the game. Being an amateur at this, all I did was cause an enormous bruise on my shin. At the same time I vowed that I would never design a feature like that, such a cheat for the player. Of all games for Wayne [Neyens] to ask me to remake! This was my chance to fix this unjust feature. I made no change in the playfield but rather added a delay relay so that the rollover was \"remembered\" until the motor finished. I didn't tell Wayne I was doing it because I was afraid he might veto it on the grounds of adding expense. When he saw the result he was glad I had done it."

		"notes": "Same playfield layout as the electromechanical Model 376, Williams' 1969 'Gridiron', but with the addition of three outfield scoring pockets.This Model 538 is listed in several Williams documents as \"Gridiron II\". However, unlike other games on these documents, no production run dates or quantities are ever indicated.According to the book Arcade Treasures, Williams promoted this game on a souvenir NFL game schedule.Reportedly, this game was made as a kit as well as a complete game. We asked Ken Fedesna, Executive VP/General Manager over Williams/Bally/Midway from 1988 until their close of pinball production in 1999, who provided this detailed information:It was referred to as GridIron II in all my notes to differentiate it from the original GridIron, so your assumption regarding this is correct. The first mention in my notes about this game was on 6/1/84 where we were trying to come up with a preliminary cost estimate for building it. A prototype build was released, but nowhere in my notes do I have the number of proto units to be built or what was built. On 10/5/84, my notes indicate that the proto cabinets and playfields were due in the following week. My notes also indicate that it was to use System 8, and that we were building 4 ramp assemblies with the motors we had in stock and had to get more motors to build more. On 10/12/84, my notes mention for the first time that we were considering making this into a conversion kit for Pennant Fever in addition to a dedicated version. On 10/29/84 (after the AMOA Show) we released 150 dedicated units and 10 Conversion kits for Purchasing to buy the parts based upon getting initial orders at the show for 150 dedicated games. Production was scheduled to start 12/17/84 at 5 to 10 per day. On 11/26 my notes indicate that production was still scheduled to start on 12/17/84. Then on 12/20/84, the entire production of this game was canceled and all parts on order were to be held until Spring to build more baseball games. At that time, our cabinet supplier had built 45 cabinets, and 60 backboxes and was told to stop. Same for Ad Poster with regards to screening playfields. If I remember correctly (?), the reason we canceled building this game was due to how late in the football season this game would be being introduced. At 5 or so a day, the 150 units wouldn't be completed until February 1985 when the football season was over. So, the reason there is no record of building any production units of this game (dedicated or kits) is because we never did build production units.We have linked to a video of a game having prototype serial number 538X22005. That game is also pictured here. The flashing bulb on the start button of this game did not work because, although it was wired from the bulb socket to the backbox connector, no wire existed from the connector to the backbox circuit board, reportedly because Williams had maxed out their transistor capacity. We don't know if other games in this run had the same issue."

Balls shot into play enter the upper playfield and if they do not land in a score hole then they fall into the upper outhole trough. Each of the six score holes is color-coded to score double if a matching ball lands in it. Player is to wait until all balls are played in this manner, then is instructed to push the red knob on the left front of cabinet, releasing the upper outhole balls into the lower playfield for a second chance to score. These balls filter down to the lower outhole trough (the Handicap Line-up). Points are awarded for each ball if its position in the lower trough matches the color-coded strip next to it. The player can release the balls to the lower playfield only once during a game, as the mechanism locks until a new game is started. We include images to show this mechanism. When this playfield is in place in the game, the wider lever on the mechanism (on the left) is pushed forward by the red knob on the front of the game resulting in the release of the captive colored balls to the lower playfield. Once the balls are launched, the gate is not operable until the start of the next game. Inserting a coin and pushing in the coin slide returns the captive gate to the ready (closed) position."

Gottlieb's previous game having a Safety Gate, Knock Out, shows a peg in the flipper gap in its flyer. The next game with a Safety Gate after Happy Go Lucky is Mermaid, and the flyer game shows a rubbered post in the gap. This indicates a change in design was made, possibly in response to operator feedback.The flyer game also has extra long flippers whereas the production games for which we have pictures all have shorter flippers, with rubbered posts to make up for the difference in flipper length. Designer Wayne Neyens had a machinist make these longer flippers from metal. Although they appeared on the game in the flyer, he tells us they did not appear on production games, saying Gottlieb \"didn't go much for innovation in those days\". Included in this listing are copies of Wayne's original sketches for this new flipper design, showing it measured more than 3 1/16 inches in length.The backglass uses musical notes to show the name of this game as hyphenated. The schematic also hyphenates the name, while the flyer and instruction card do not. Wayne wrote the original name for this game was \"Ten Little Indians\" (his sketch indicates \"10 Little Indians\") to go with the sequences of ten on the playfield."

		"notes": "This game was intended to emulate the success of Gottlieb's 'Silver Slugger' which was a low-cost game with earnings that rivaled expensive Williams/Bally games like 'Diner'. Hence it has virtually no ramps, toys, or backbox animation.The original title was 'Poker Night' with a theme centering around a congregation of poker-playing, pizza-eating men. Reportedly, one target was required to 'answer the phone'.This was the last Bally game to have alphanumeric score displays.We had heard there was a second run of this game by this manufacturer. We asked Ken Fedesna, Executive VP/General Manager over Williams/Bally/Midway from 1988 until their close of pinball production in 1999, who checked his information and found no evidence of a second run. In searching, he came up with this detailed information about the first (and only) run:1) On 10/19/90 we released 15 prototypes to be built starting 11/15/90.2) The first screened playfields for these protos arrived on 11/12, at which time Engineering in combination with the manufacturing prototype line started putting them together on 11/14. 3) The 15 prototype games were all completed by 12/10/90. On 12/10 we released 250 samples to be built starting on 1/7/91. 4) On 12/20, we had a management discussion regarding the cost to build this game and what we would sell it for. It was decided to offer the game to distributors for a selling price of $2045 net. 5) The 250 sample games were completed by the end of February, 1991. 6) Production started in April of 1991 and was completed by June of 1991. 7) There were a total of 2202 games built and sold (inclusive of the 15 prototypes, samples, and production).We would always build approximately 15 prototypes (combination of engineering personnel and manufacturing personnel) to prove out the design and provide early field testing units for earning potential. We would then build 200 to 250 samples on the sample production line to make sure we had all the design/manufacturing bugs worked out. These 250 samples would then be sold to distribution in order for them to get an idea of the game's potential. From these samples, we would then ask for the first production sale's orders. Harley was an experiment to see if we could bring to market a more simple playing game with a lower cost.",

These differences were necessary for games shipped to Italy, a country that had banned 'extra balls' at the time.We have seen this game with the following names in center playfield above the Gottlieb logo:1) 'Pleasure Isle' printed on the playfield.2) 'Hawaiian Isle' printed on a rectangle of white paint apparently covering up the name 'Pleasure Isle'.3) 'Hawaiian Isle' printed on the playfield.We don't know the reason for these differences or the quantities of each. We numbered them in a sequence to support a probable theory that 'Pleasure Isle' playfields were used for this game until new playfields could be properly screened with the correct name.We indicate the Model Number of this game is '235it'. However, Federico Croci, a collector in Italy, reports there is no Model Number on its schematic, on the playfield, on the backglass, not anywhere. Two cards inside the cabinet, the \"Motor Score Unit Switches\" and \"Post Adjustments\" are the same ones used on 'Pleasure Isle' and have Model Number '235' printed on them, but 'Hawaiian Isle' has many differences with that model."

The play strategy is to first load up the two Alley-Ways with trapped balls, then shoot for the top Hit lane. A ball thru the Hit lane makes the green light come on and both ball-stops pivot to release all trapped balls to the large 1000-point scoring hole. A ball thru the Miss lane makes the red light come on and all trapped balls are instead routed to the outhole at bottom.",
		"notes": "This is one of five different games that PAMCO advertised collectively as the \"Quintuplets\". According to an article in the Coin Machine Journal (May 1935, pages 73-75) in which PAMCO owner Fred McClellan introduced the games in an interview, each had a miniature cabinet measuring 14 by 25 inches (ads indicate 14 3/8 by 25 1/4 inches) intended for locations where a larger cabinet would not fit. The game could be operated as a pin table, or the legs could be easily detached to make it a counter game. There was nothing mounted inside the cabinet except an \"entirely new\" ball lift and plunger assembly not used on previous games. All other internal mechanisms were mounted to the underside of the slide-out playfield.\"Hit or Miss\" was identified by PAMCO as the first of the five games. Advertised pictures of it can be seen with a thin vertical marquee mounted at the rear of the cabinet showing the words \"Quintuplet No. 1\" on it, while the actual name of the game appears in the upper playfield.In the above article, McClellan said the original idea was to make replacement playfields for their Contact games but instead they saw demand for a complete and miniature game. The name \"Quintuplets\" was to capitalize on the international popularity of the Dionne quintuplets born in Canada only the year before. Just as the prematurely-born Dionne babies were displayed in incubators to an admiring public, McClellan displayed his five new \"baby games\" in his showrooms in what he called \"a strictly modern conception of the coin machine incubator\".The other four games are:PAMCO's 1935 'Make or Break'PAMCO's 1935 'Odd or Even'PAMCO's 1935 'Double or Nothing'PAMCO's 1935 'Left or Right'In an interview with pinball historian Russ Jensen on March 24, 1982, Harry Williams thought Bon MacDougall was responsible for the design of the Quintuplet games, but we have been unable to pin this down definitively."

Some games had eight mechanical flippers, such as Ad-Lee Company's 1932 'Double-Shuffle'. Most were \"manually-operated\" bats used on baseball games, one to a playfield.  'Humpty Dumpty' is the first pinball machine manufactured with flippers that were electromechanical. According to the book Pinball 1, David Gottlieb wanted to name this game 'Flipper' but a legal check found a patented countertop game that had a manual bat, Smith Manufacturing Company's 1932 'Flipper'.Included in this listing is an image of a Billboard ad where a distributor enthusiastically thanks Gottlieb \"for making the greatest improvement in the history of pin games\". 'Humpty Dumpty' was out for less than a month at the time the ad was published, which further highlights the immediate impact this game had on the industry.Harry Mabs, a Gottlieb employee, is credited with inventing the EM flipper. Jerry Koci, who worked for Chicago Coin, claimed to have invented it, for which he received a patent. See Chicago Coin's 1947 'Bermuda' for more information.A method of player-control other than flippers is found on Rock-ola's 1932 'Juggle Ball'.",

Mark Ritchie confirmed to us that this is a reference to his previous game, Williams' 1992 'Fish Tales'.Early Production games had at least three differences from production games. The mini-playfield has steel side rails instead of red plastic. The Super Jackpot insert background is black-and-white instead of all black. Three Jackpot symbols illuminate on the speaker panel below the DMD. These three lamps do not light up on production games because those games are not equipped with the lamps and the board to support them. In fact, the backbox insert is not drilled with the three holes. However, the software on production games still supports this missing prototype feature, so it is possible to modify a production game to have this feature by drilling the holes in the insert and installing the lamps and the board.Early Production games have a large decorative plastic all along the back wall of the playfield, removed from later games. Reportedly, some game owners have obtained and re-installed this so-called \"lost plastic\".Another player-controlled tilting mini-playfield is found on Premier's 1993 'Wipe Out'.",

It was remade as the 4-player SS game Mylstar's 1984 'Jacks to Open'.The playfield in the manufacturer's flyer has white paint in the flipper \"swipe\" area and along the upper ball arch. All games pictured here show these same areas as unpainted.Tim Arnold contacted us with the following information for 'Jacks Open', 1976 'Volley', and 1977 'Big Hit' that explains these playfield color differences:I have noticed a mystery on these three games I can solve for you. I have had many examples of these machines over the years. Playfields with PAINT over [flipper] swipe area and top arch are made of CHIPBOARD! I first saw this at Cleveland Coin back in the day when we were thinking of buying the game off the floor. Our salesman told us to take one in the box as the painted over area was \"Pressed wood\". I later talked to Cliff Strain [in Sales] at an annual trade show. He told me they were trying new materials because of a spike in the price of plywood. I have had two of these three machines since then, and the paint seems to stick to the wood just fine, but the surface turns rough and bumpley (sic) under the paint."

Note that the order in which the drop targets stand is different from 'Jacks Open'.John Trudeau, a fellow designer at Mylstar, provided us the following information: 'Jacks to Open' served as the test platform for the first alphanumeric displays, although they first appeared in production on Premier's 1985 'Chicago Cubs \"Triple Play\"'. We actually made ten complete 'Jack to Open' games with the alphanumeric display and a new backglass (having new art to fit the openings for the new digits). There was some management concern that it wouldn't make any difference in the cashbox. That turned out to be undetermined, since there really was no way to tell how much the game would have made without it, at the same location. But we did get some positive feedback because of the initials-entering capability it now had. And players in general liked the displayed messages too."

We show one image with the leg removed, revealing a single bolt hole with an angled cut to the cabinet's corner edge. Presumably, the leg was keyed to match this angle, although we do not yet have pictures of the inside of the leg to prove this.According to Dick Bueschel's book Pinball 1, the formal name of this game is the single word 'Jigsaw'. However, it was frequently advertised as 'World's Fair Jigsaw'. The manufacturer advertised it both ways, and also showed a hyphenated spelling of 'Jig-Saw' on the playfield. When variations exist, we often list a game name by how it appears on the playfield, to facilitate its recognition."

		"notes": "Originally named 'Conflict'. The 'Joust' name was used for a video game released in 1981.The game pictured in the flyer has an apron colored blue and red. The ends of its legs are squared off. We do not know how many games left the factory with these features, as most of the games we see have black and red aprons, with legs rounded at the ends.Pictured in this listing is an Early Production game with serial number XP0223. It has the blue/red apron and squared legs.Also included in this listing is a pictorial comparison of two games from Quebec, Canada having several production differences between them. For ease of comparison, we have arbitrarily assigned them as Game 'A' and Game 'B' without trying to suggest which game was made first.  Game play is slightly different from each other: Just before the last 30-second unlimited ball mode starts, one game has all lights go out (including GI's), while the other game has only the insert lights going out for about 5 seconds before the unlimited ball mode starts.We have labeled the images that accompany this list to correspond with each item listed.Game 'A' has blue/red aprons with squared leg ends. Serial number 625510.1a) Certain inserts are clear and faceted.2a) The metal mini-post next to the spinning target has a different size of screw thread and does not fit Game 'B'.3a) Egg Multiplier uses four plastic posts.4a) Lock-down hasps have wide handles.5a) Three fuses inside front door.6a) Sound board has unused connector pins.7a) Power supply board has a fourth fuse.8a) Screw heads are visible on the wood-grain area of cabinet.9a) The square bar under the lockdown bar attaches to notches cut into the inside wall of the cabinet. The outside wall of the cabinet is undisturbed.Game 'B' has blue/red aprons with rounded leg ends. Serial number 623689.1b) Certain inserts are opaque and not faceted.2b) The metal mini-post next to the spinning target has a different size of screw thread and does not fit Game 'A'. (image not shown)3b) Egg Multiplier uses three plastic posts and one metal one.4b) Lock-down hasps have narrow handles.5b) No fuses inside front door.6b) Sound board does not have unused connector pins.7b) Power supply board has a soldered wire, instead of a fourth fuse, that seems factory-original.8b) Screw heads are visible on the inside of cabinet, not on the outside.9b) The square bar under the lockdown bar attaches to notches cut into the inside wall of the cabinet. However, the picture shows the notches were originally cut completely through the cabinet wall then pieces of the cut-out cabinet were glued back in place to be flush with the outside cabinet wall. Almost as if they goofed and never meant to cut completely through the cabinet. This suggests experimentation.There was suggestion that two production runs of Joust had occurred and with the same number of games produced in each run. We asked designer Barry Oursler about that. He replies:There was NEVER a second Joust game. There would have been another Joust-type game if it had sold well enough. But as you know, nothing sold well between 1983-1985. We may have made some rule changes to the game after it was on test for a while, but I don�t recall any  physical changes, other that the colors, like you mentioned."

The owner stated there are no backglass, playfield, cabinet, or gameplay differences between the two games. However, the backbox of #1001 has a third cable connector plug coming from the main cabinet that the later one does not have. It does not have the relay located above the replay mechanism that the later one does have. The owner had no information for these extra differences in #1001 except to comment that the 2nd player unit had a lot of wires that may have needed the third connector plug.In The Pinball Compendium 1970-1981 page 14, Jim Patla stated that, as Ted Zale's \"pupil\", he helped Zale with the design of this game.

It shows a game having no serial number and its legs are missing. It measures 24 1/2 inches by 24 1/2 inches, and 9 inches high without its legs, or 12 inches high without legs but including the leg attachment skirt. The ball lift appears to have been altered from original, changed to a 'Ballyround' type of combination ball lifter and shooter mechanism. No lift-up top. Access to the playfield requires removing screws around the playfield glass. The cabinet is laminated wood, not solid wood. The baffle board under the playfield is slightly concave, as is the playfield, and it was this saucer shape that helped doom Ballyround to being recalled by its manufacturer due to its chronic mechanical failure. However, the failed Ballyround baffle board rotated around a central axis, while this baffle board moves back and forth just like the flat ones under traditional rectangular playfields. Whether that really solved a problem or not, the manufacture of square machines did not last beyond 1933."

Christian met Norm Clark and Steve Kordek and gave them his opinion on what they were doing, and the exchange was apparently very interesting. Steve Kordek was in the final stages of getting Jubilee ready for production. He had planned four pop bumpers on the playfield, the two bottom ones on either side of the captive balls, like on Whoopee. Christian told him that it would make the game less interesting for the players as those two pop bumpers would prevent the ball from being sent back to the top of the playfield and would help lose the ball quickly. The result is that the pop bumpers were replaced by two rollover buttons which add to the bonus..and a game which was certainly more interesting to play."

The test game version would lock balls on a ring that rotated slowly around the planet, until the third ball was locked, and then all three balls would be released by the Space Station Robotic Arm (a magnetic crane) for multi-ball.In the production games, the locks are virtual and only the third locked ball is actually diverted to the planet, where it goes directly from the loading ramp to the crane and is lifted out immediately. The holes in the ring were cut open so if the crane ever failed, the balls will just fall off the ring as it turns.It has been suggested that this feature was changed because it failed under test, leaving balls trapped on the ring. We asked designer John Trudeau about it. He clarifies:The original ring and [software] program were only used on the prototypes and sample games.  Nothing ever failed and all the games worked flawlessly, throughout their stays at their test locations.  Even the sample games sent to Europe worked well.  The problem was with the German distributor.  He said he saw a potential for failure with the ball crane.  In other words, he just didn't like it.  I don't know why.  And I never actually heard what he threatened Williams with, but it was enough pressure to have the game changed.  I fought the good fight for keeping it the way it was, but I didn't have big enough clout to outweigh the potential loss of sales.  So I swallowed what pride I had left and changed it.  It wasn't as cool as having the balls in orbit, but there was a lot of game still there to have fun with. The same potential \"failure lock-up\" point is at ANY ball popper or even the outhole.  It just never made any sense to me. The prototype games were all retrofitted with a new ring and program. The distributors were all sent conversion kits to refit their sample games to the modified play.  Whether these kits ever actually found their way onto the sample games was up to the distributors. The incentive for the distributors to do the conversion was the fact that any subsequent software updates would have the \"new\" ring in mind. The \"old\" ring would only work with that original software release. I would expect that everyone would eventually do the mod.Any regular production game having a planet ring that matches the one shown in the flyer has been fitted with an after-factory reproduction of the prototype/sample model, and the game programming should have been adjusted to support this change.Trudeau also advises us that Judge Dredd was the only \"Superpin\" to feature \"Supergame\", an entirely multiball game that could be had for an additional credit. \"Supergame\" also had its own High Score To Date records shown in the dot matrix display.",

The announcement also states this game was \"praised by operators\" but, according to Marketplace Pictorial History,  Dec 1981 - Jan 1983 page 113, King Fish was mechanically deficient and Genco received so many complaints from operators that they were forced to take the games back. If the games were then destroyed or reused for future non-payout games, perhaps that is why we find no modern pictures of surviving examples."

This sample also has decagon score reels showing two different sizes of numbers. The 'tens' and 'hundreds' reel uses the shorter and thicker numbers as seen in the flyer.

Two earlier Bally games, 1965 Fun Cruise and 1966 Deluxe Fun Cruise, used a silkscreened '0' for the ones-digit. Reportedly, the \"dummy zero\" was not just a plastic score reel segment as was typical of later games but was a full score reel without the mechanism. This plastic reel was kept in place by using an angular piece of metal screwed to the wood of the inside of the backbox. We have no pictures of this dummy reel.Pictured in this listing is an Early Production game with serial number 1054 having cabinet artwork that matches the flyer."

The manufacturer's ads of March and April (shown here) indicate that orders were being taken for future delivery. Only at the end of April does an ad announce that this game was actually in production.We have seen no photographs of the game shown in the ads and we wonder if it was actually made. A Billboard ad dated May 1935 announced that production for 'Kings of the Turf' was starting that month, and all games that followed that announcement had a different playfield and cabinet. From this, we believe there are two models of this game, with the change occurring in May, and perhaps this \"first model\" never got off the ground. From examining the ads, we list here its most dependable characteristics that will distinguish it from the second model:The game name at top of playfield is not displayed on a ribbon banner.Below the name, the horses race to the left.The playfield is a single background color.The center of race track in lower playfield does not have numbers in it.The coin slide has an oblong multiple-coin view window.The second model is Evans' 1935 'Kings of the Turf (Second Model)'."

Allan Reizman, Engineering Lab Supervisor at Bally, shares his remembrances of this:The talking Kiss prototype did make it out of the lab at least once and was displayed at the 1979 AMOA show in Chicago where it was viewed by all. I believe it said things like, \"Shoot the K\" and \"Kiss!\" when you completed a Kiss row. Somebody recently reminded me it groaned, \"Too much Rock and Roll!\" when you tilted it. The game was only done as a one-time concept.In this listing is number three of a reported eleven prototypes made, and the Bally paperwork refers to it as an Engineering Sample. The information provided by its owner is as follows:Bally gave their employee Bruce Kalas this Kiss game on June 29, 1982. Bruce had the game until 1988. Project number NT 1152. Per Bruce, the game did work. The backglass does not lift out, it hinges. There is no on/off switch under the cabinet bottom. The game is supposed to start by typing in a code in the backbox keypad, which has the words Game, Enter, and Test. There are no batteries on the board(s) in the backbox. The ROMS say \"experimental\". Every coil is marked by hand.The owner subsequently commented on what the original Bally owner had told him about the disposition of the other ten prototypes:This machine (serial number 1152-3) was given to the original owner free by Bally. He said the boss came and told all the workers to come and stand by the machine that they wanted and the Kiss prototypes were the only ones left from which to choose. There were 11 prototypes and he was the last employee to choose so he got prototype number 3. The other 8 were destroyed with sledgehammers. He said he watched them do it. He claims he didn't want the machine but the price was free so he took it."

One of them, pictured below, was a modification to accept multiple coins and denominations. The front of its cabinet was extended underneath to accommodate the large ABT coin mechanism attached to the front door. This mechanism accepted nickels, dimes, and quarters and advanced the credit unit accordingly, without making change. The front coin door had a credit light and an illuminated credit button for dark locations. A Merkle-Korff motor, mounted underneath the playfield, would run one cycle to reset the game, simulating the thrust of a coin slide. The wood legs were uniquely painted especially for the Show, and are pictured here repainted to match the original design.The other prototype, not shown here, had glass sides with all the interior mechanisms chrome-plated and all the wires laid out in direct, straight runs!Lady Robin Hood was Gottlieb's second game with flippers, following Humpty Dumpty, and they produced 6,000 units which was nearly six times the volume of each of the three flipperless games that preceded these two games. A brief article in Billboard from Mar-6-1948 p118 reports that Nate Gottlieb was suffering from a laryngitis attack caused, Nate said, by handling so many inquiries for this game."

As an example, see Gottlieb's 1935 'Plus and Minus'.The solenoid-operated aluminum Liberty Bell mint vendor was invented by Edmund Fey and was used primarily on slot machines although its design allowed it for use on other devices such as this pinball machine. Its view window was supposed to permanently display five packages of mints to give the impression that the vendor was always full. A nice article from his son Marshall Fey appeared in the October 1985 issue of Loose Change magazine and discussed this invention as well as a 1914 patent for a rotary-piston internal combustion engine, granted to Carl E. Anderson and Edmund C. Fey."

However, to resolve a royalty disparity between the two manufacturers, Williams changed the name of this Exhibit game to 'Lightning'. The EOP does not pinpoint whether production began before or after the name was changed, and this allows for the possibility that there could have been some of these 1934 'Contact' games made by Exhibit. If that is true, it could explain any otherwise unaccountable variations in design or style for 'Contact' games identified as made by PAMCO. 'Lightning' is the first pin table made by Exhibit, and their first EM game. Exhibit made two sizes, 18 x 36 inches, and 22 by 44 inches. For easy identification, pinball literature will include the cabinet length after the name. Our website adds the designation \"First Style\" as well. The playfield layout was the same as 'Contact'. This became problematic from a marketing standpoint, so Harry Williams redesigned 'Lightning' to have a new and different upper playfield than 'Contact', colored red, and a different cabinet. This redesigned game is known as Exhibit's 1934 'Lightning 38 (New Style)'."

This caused the Accumulator balls to drop under the playfield to a kicker which would shoot them onto the lower playfield continuously until they all landed in score holes. Shooting a ball into either of the top High Voltage holes routed it to the corresponding left or right side playfield to be kicked upwards to a progressive scoring hole. Making the Live Power hole advanced the balls in the progressive scoring holes to the next highest point holes. This feature is an early example of score-advanced captive balls. Outhole balls in the upper playfield were released for replay whenever the Live Power hole was made. Game was 20 inches by 40 inches.

The 100,000 digit is a silkscreened \"1\" that is lit from behind when earned. The backbox pictured in the manufacturer's flyer has an actual score reel for the 100,000 position, as evidenced by the part number visible just underneath the \"1\" on the reel. This game has five actual score reels plus one dummy reel. One can barely discern in the flyer that the silkscreened number 1,000,000 appears where the words \"Over The Top\" are found in production games. If you have seen an example of the version in the flyer, please contact us with your pictures."

Scoring a number on the playfield in this manner lights the corresponding number on the backglass \"clock face\".The mini-playfield kicks the captive ball into action whenever the regular ball in play leaves the playfield via the H or D outlanes, or via the gobble holes. Therefore, only one kick of the captive ball can be earned per ball in play.A lighted spinner behind the backglass clock when at rest points to any one of the eight numbers. This spinner is activated every time the mini-playfield ball is kicked into action. It spins continously once activated and does not stop until the mini-playfield ball returns to rest at its starting point. If the spinning light stops next to any clock number that is lit, a replay is awarded.  Lighting 1 through 8 on the playfield lights the two outlanes between the flippers for Special. Lighting all four H-O-L-D outlanes in any sequence lights the center target for Special. It would take four balls to achieve this, therefore only the fifth ball in play could ever hit the center target lit for Special.Replay wheel maximum: 45",

In another Williams game having this feature, Williams' 1955 'Smoke Signal', a replay is awarded when all five balls drain in this way. Reportedly, the schematic for Lulu does not indicate any reward or other function is tied to the lighting of these five inserts."

In the late 1990's or so, he composed a list of games that he had designed while at Williams and this game is not one of them. The manufacturer's original playfield drawing (not shown here) is stamped ORIGINAL, dated 6/10/60 and is signed by (Harry) Mabs (drawn by him, with signature and initials). The scoring notations on this drawing look completely like Steve Kordek�s handwriting, not the shaky handwriting of Mabs' recent games, so he must have been helping Mabs.

Olive St in Los Angeles. They had taken over the building vacated when A.M. Amusement Games closed. However, included in this listing is a picture of the game instructions indicating the manufacturer is Western Manufacturing Company located at the same address.We were contacted by the granddaughter of Kenneth F. Thompson, who she said was the owner of Allied Amusements in Los Angeles, but that he sold the company to Richard Dixon who, she said, later sold it to Bally. Her uncle subsequently told her that Thompson worked at Allied for about one year in the 1930s and that he invented a coil used in the machines, although the uncle believed Thompson didn't receive anything for his invention. The granddaughter sent us a photograph of the Majik Keys production line (shown here) that she identified as the Los Angeles address. Richard Dixon is identified in this 1934 photo but his role as either owner or employee in this photo is not indicated.A possible explanation for the information we have is that during the production run of this game in 1934, Dixon bought Allied and changed the company name to Western Manufacturing. Perhaps Thompson changed the name before selling to Dixon. The game pictured here has a coin slide with patent dates of May 9, 1933 and May 16, 1933, per the owner."

		"notes": "This first version of 'Major League' had problems with the game not always batting the ball. Games were yanked from location within 30 days after deliveries began. The playfield was subsequently redesigned as PAMCO's 1934 'Major League (Model 40)' and PAMCO's 1934 'Major League (Model 44)' and with new advertising for them clearly pointing out, \"A new added feature: a batter automatically up every time.\"According to Dick Bueschel's Encyclopedia of Pinball Vol 2, a manufacturer announcement for this game in August 1934 indicated its size was 44 inches by 24 inches. However, the manufacturer's October 1934 ad announced the two new versions and stated, \"We are continuing the 44� x 22� size.\"The original designers were in-house designer C. Hale and outside contract designer Harry Williams. Williams had left the company shortly after this game had been started. Race car driver and wingwalker Bon MacDougall was brought in as designer around the time of Williams' departure. MacDougall incorporated all of the drawings and ideas of Hale and Williams with his own to present a patentable submission to the U.S. Patent Office in June 1934 resulting in the two subsequent versions.Inferential reading of Bueschel�s book indicates this game was made at the manufacturer�s Los Angeles location.The upper playfield design most easily differentiates the three versions of Pacific�s Major League if a model number is not evident on the lower apron:� This original model has one hole at the top of the playfield and no chevron hole arrangement below it.� Model 44 has two holes arranged vertically at the top of the playfield. Just below them are five holes in the formation of a shallow chevron. The Batter Up hole has an elevated pair of baseball bats to capture the ball.� Model 40 has one hole, not two, at the top of the playfield, and the chevron is deeper, not shallow. The pair of bats are painted on the playfield. The game example pictured here has had advertising stickers placed all over the playfield, and any bat design at the top may be under a sticker. The playfield is missing its ball rails and some pins. The cabinet measures 44 inches long, 21 3/4 inches wide, and 8 1/2 inches high, not including the trim. The trim extends 1/4 inch all the way around the cabinet.One of the designers of this game, C. Hale, was reported in the October 1935 issue of Automatic Age, page 105, as a new employee of California Exhibit Company working as an Associate Engineer in their Research Department. In that article, he was described as previously having been an \"associate developer\" of this 1934 game and of Allied Amusement's 1935 'Barrel Roll'."

Completing a sequence resets the sequence to allow this again. Both kick-out holes eject the ball upwardly. The lower kick-out hole has a metal pin guarding each side of it, making it difficult or impossible to land a ball into it from certain directions.",
		"notes": "Pictured in this listing is a Sample game imported from Belgium having serial number 01006 S. It has a plexiglas backglass. The red and yellow bumper caps have rounded dome tops instead of the inclined flat tops seen on production games. We have annotated a motor board image to encircle two extra relays that do not appear on the sample schematic. Only one of them appears on the sample motor card. They was identified by the owner as the \"first coin relay\" and the \"Y\" Relay (second coin relay).The following information explains how the A-B-C-D rollovers operate to award added balls and is taken directly from the Majorettes schematic: At the start of the game, all four rollovers (A-B-C-D) are LIT.  Each time you cross a rollover lane the corresponding letter goes OUT.  When you get all four letters out, you get an add-a-ball and the letters reset on a \"mystery\" basis, which means from one to three letters will re-light, and the other letters will be knocked out (spotted) for you by the machine.   Whatever letters have been re-lit will need to be crossed again to get another add-a-ball and yet another \"mystery\" reset.  This \"mystery\" reset process for the A-B-C-D rollovers continues for the entire game.   The \"mystery\" function works as follows when the rollovers are reset after getting an add-a-ball:- The A rollover is always re-lit.- The B rollover will be spotted only if the RED #3 bumper is NOT lit.  If the RED #3 bumper is lit, the B rollover will be re-lit.- The C rollover is always spotted.- The D rollover will be spotted only if the YELLOW #3 bumper is NOT lit.  If the YELLOW #3 bumper is lit, the D rollover will be re-lit.  Thus, when the A-B-C-D lanes reset, the number of lanes that are spotted for you (making it easier to complete the sequence again) is a function of how far along you are in completing the bumper sequences.  The closer you are to lighting an add-a-ball special via the bumpers, the fewer of the A-B-C-D lanes that will be spotted for you.   The mechanics of the spotting function are not explained to the player in the instructions, which is why this is called a \"mystery\" spot feature."

The lit car steps twelve times on the backglass to award 1000 points at the twelfth step, and each step alternates the yellow and green rollovers for 1000 points when lit. Scoring either yellow or green rollover when lit lights correspondingly colored bumpers for 1000 points which can then also advance car. The white bumper at bottom of playfield sits between two rollovers and not only advances the car when hit but alternately lights these rollovers to score the backglass Bonus value of 1000 to 15000 points depending on Bonus ladder position, then the Bonus resets. If A-B-C were already made in sequence, scoring a lit bottom rollover awards free plays instead of points.",
		"notes": "'Metro' is an early example of a game that has a bonus ladder to award points, drawing a comparison to games made in the 1970's and later that had this feature. However, these 70's and later games were designed to award the bonus ladder value once the ball landed in the outhole, and this is known as the end-of-ball bonus. On Metro, the bonus ladder is awarded only via a bottom rollover when it's lit, not at the outhole. In addition, balls can reach the outhole without passing through a bottom rollover in which case the bonus ladder value is not earned or awarded. Therefore, while Metro has a bonus ladder, it does not have an end-of-ball bonus. The bonus value can only be awarded during game play."

		"notes": "More than one playfield variation has been identified. The most consequential difference between them is the position of the upper left flipper, a change that also caused the adjacent playfield plastic to be resized. This flipper was moved from being offset lower than the right flipper to being offset higher. This design change also seemed to be an opportunity to make some artwork changes. One notable change is the placement of the words \"Same Player Shoots Again\" in the gap between the lower flippers, repositioned from being left-justified in that gap to being right-justified. For each type of playfield, we have itemized the characteristics that are different from the other playfields, if read from top to bottom.Pre-production playfield (shown here)Same Player Shoots Again is left-justified.Upper left flipper is offset lower than upper right flipper.The center plastic (immediate left of upper left flipper) is larger, not smaller.The animal on this center plastic is facing left, not right.Perimeter around pop bumpers are painted rings, not a wide band of unpainted wood.The animal next to the left pop bumper is brown, not green.The playfield color in front of the upper drop target bank is blue, not red.Top plastics have sky color of light purple, not blue and dark purple.Left slingshot plastic background colors are orange and purple, not solid purple.Yellow art trim not yet added.The unpainted playfield areas are brown, not white.The cardholder trim is a lighter color, not darker, than the major color.The inserts for the standup targets are white, not green.Flyer playfield, small image, bottom of page 3 (shown here)No noticeable changes from pre-production playfield except the unpainted areas look white, not brown.The upper left flipper is still offset lower than upper right flipper.The adjacent center plastic is still large and the animal is still facing left.Flyer playfield, large image, pages 2-3 (shown here)The upper left flipper has been moved to be offset higher than the right one.The adjacent center plastic is now smaller and the animal is still facing left.The unpainted areas are still white, not brown.Production playfields (shown here)Same Player Shoots Again is now right-justified.Upper left flipper is offset higher than upper right flipper.The adjacent plastic is still the smaller size than before.The animal on this smaller center plastic is now facing right, not left.Perimeter around pop bumpers are still the painted rings, not a wide band of unpainted wood.The animal next to the left pop bumper is now green, not brown.The playfield color in front of the upper drop target bank is now red, not blue.Top plastics have sky color that are now blue and dark purple, no longer just light purple.Left slingshot plastic background color is now solid purple, no longer orange and purple.Yellow lines of art trim have now been added (left outlane, right inlane, 500 w/l near left slingshot, 100 w/l and 1000 w/l near bottom drop targets).The unpainted playfield areas are once again brown, not white.The cardholder trim is now a darker color, not lighter, than the major color.The inserts for the standup targets still are white, not green.Production variation (shown here)This playfield has two differences that are unique from the other production ones:The inserts for the standup targets are green, not white.The pop bumper areas are unpainted white wood, not brown, and this unpainted area extends outward beyond the pop bumper platter approximately one inch all the way around. This game is one of two such games that the owner had during 2000-2002 The owner, who last had this game around 2002, placed translucent red ring protectors to protect this unpainted wood. In the pictures shown here, we can see that the red rings do not quite have the diameter of the unpainted area and a very thin outer circle of white wood can still be seen. The owner reports he has seen two games having this unique playfield many years ago and wonders if they were Later Production changes, perhaps in response to excessive pop bumper wear. For these two games, he did not notice any differences in cabinet or backglass art. No cabinet serial numbers were recorded."

To qualify for extra ball, making A-B-C-D targets light the correspondingly lettered bumpers at top of playfield. Lighting all four A-B-C-D bumpers light the two horseshoe inserts, qualifying the horseshoe lane rollover button (which does not light) to award the extra ball. The schematic indicates that flashing bulbs are to be used for the horseshoe inserts. A ball rolling over the horseshoe lane button at this point will turn off the flashing horseshoe inserts and quietly award the extra ball, with no knocker sound. There are no inserts or text on the playfield or backglass to indicate the extra ball has been awarded, thus this event may go unnoticed by an uninformed player. Once the current ball in play reaches the outhole, the ball counter does not increment, the ball is served again to the shooter lane, and the A-B-C-D bumpers turn off to allow a new extra ball to be earned.",

In later games, this eye was silkscreened onto the glass with the rest of the art.A change was made during production to increase the size of the long plastic next to the messenger ball lane to provide a hood over the standup target so the messenger ball, if hit hard by the ball in play, would not jump out of the lane after hitting the target. We provide an image of the two styles of plastic, placed side by side.At the 2004 Texas Pinball Festival, O'Connor stated he got the idea for the artwork for this game, delivered to him as a blank whitewood, because he was interested in and dabbling with magic at the time."

		"notes": "After over 60 software revisions 'Nine Ball' still did not work properly on location. Reportedly, proper adjustment of ball lock switches can remedy this (if using Rev. 60).We've had reports of machines found with both M-100 and M-200 MPU boards controlling them; the manual shows M-200 MPU boards.The artist's inspiration for the wizard design on the backglass and playfield came from a design on a T-shirt, one of which can be seen in Roger Sharpe's 1977 book Pinball! on page 13.Stern programmer Alan McNeil told us that the mini-post screw between the flippers was known as a Kirk Post (for designer Steve Kirk).The games pictured in this listing (except for the flyer game) have a sticker on the lower apron identifying this game as \"selected for tournament play\". Designer Steve Kirk was founder and president of the Pinball Association of America, organizing major tournaments since the 1970s. Reportedly, these stickers, his idea, were installed on each apron in the production run. The backglass carries the silkscreened words \"Tournament Pinball\".Manufacturer data for Nine Ball:Production Start Date: 12/17/80Production End Date: 4/6/81Quantity produced: 2279"

As the flyer illustrates, the game was initially produced using a molded alligator to jump out from under the swamp reeds to capture a nearby ball. However, the plastic alligator kept breaking on location, so this design was changed early in production to instead use a bare metal bar to grab the ball, while the swamp reeds lane plastic was redesigned to show the alligator. Only a minority of games produced have the original Balligator design.",

		"notes": "A Sample game with serial number �01046 S� is pictured here. The primary differences from the Production version are:1) Backglass: the words 'Game Over' are obvious when not lit. The Production game does not have this.2) Playfield: only the white inserts are translucent. The other inserts are transparent. In contrast, all inserts on the Production version are translucent.3) Cabinet: the front has a blue stripe on the hinge side and a red stripe on the lock side, as shown in the flyer. Production games have the red and blue reversed from this.The game in the flyer has a Production backglass, the translucent inserts of a Sample playfield, and the striping of a Sample cabinet.We show two examples of Sample backglasses. One glass, having partial serial number ending with '076 S', has areas where the reds have obviously faded: the lady's parka and boots, the polar bear's tongue, the musical G-clef, the thin oval loop around the score reels, the striped North Pole, and the letters spelling Game Over. Initially, it seemed hard to believe that the variegated sky all along the top of  this glass had suffered from red fade as well, given how remarkably selective the red fading would have had to have been to have wound up looking like the checkerboard pattern that remains, had it originally been the two-tone red like the production glasses,  and with even the  vertical red squiggly lines having survived. At first, we thought this variegation were original Sample colors especially when we saw how strongly the variegation showed up on our black-and white Sample image from a German magazine from 1967, where the alternating light and dark pattern seemed more pronounced than on any Production glass. However, the alternation of light and dark in this magazine image does not match this Sample glass. When we subsequently received Sample glass number �01046 S� having no red fade in any areas, its alternating red and orange sky may be what the camera picked up in the German magazine image.In the book The Pinball Compendium Electro-mechanical Era, Wayne Neyens explained that Roy Parker is the artist of this game, not Art Stenholm as previously believed. Wayne points out that he (Wayne) was there when the artwork came in (from Advertising Posters, Inc.).Comparisons have been made by others of the artwork of North Star and backglass art known to have been done by Art Stenholm, on the belief that he is the actual artist of this game and not Parker, noting for example his style of drawing faces and his use of people seated with their legs folded and/or playing guitar. We have not studied all of Parker's glasses to try to determine if Stenholm's portrayals were exclusively his, and no one has approached us as having done this study.Dave Gottlieb had stipulated that Roy Parker work exclusively for Gottlieb. Wayne stated that Parker's last artwork for Gottlieb before his death was Mayfair in 1966, and Stenholm's first game for Gottlieb was Masquerade, also in 1966. This is two years after North Star. Wayne did tell us later that it was possible that Stenholm was helping Parker and that Gottlieb was just not aware of that. We note that Stenholm succeeded Parker as the Gottlieb artist, suggesting that he was preferred over the remaining choices at Advertising Posters, and from this we speculate his artwork would not have been unacceptable to Gottlieb in 1964.We followed up with Wayne about the continuing concern. He comments on separate occasions:Parker was our Artist until he passed away December 18, 1965. He was employed by Reproduction Graphics until they burned down for the second and  last time. It was then that we went to Advertising Posters and started doing business with them but with the stipulation that they would hire Parker and that he would work solely for Gottlieb. Now Leroy Parker was an honorable man and I cannot see him coming over to our office and presenting Stenholm's work as his own. I can perhaps visualize a studio full of pieces of paper with sketches of various poses etc. of all kinds and Parker might have picked one up and copied it. But you know that Parker also had a studio at his home where he did a lot of his work. I would also think it more likely that Stenholm copied from Parker.As for North Star, we built that game starting in September of 1964. That would mean the art work would have been completed several months prior to September 1964. Parker died December 18, 1965 and as far as I can recall he did all our work right up into 1965.  Now I suppose it is possible that Art was assisting Parker and we were not aware of it. Studying the picture I can say that it is not one of Parker's greatest glasses but his style shows through I believe."

Both were made by the manufacturer without flippers. The rolldown version has a ball dispenser instead of a plunger.The rolldown version shown in this listing has different wording on the playfield than the standard version. It reads \"Special Reserve\" in most places. At the bottom of the playfield, the paint is mostly worn away to reveal the original wording \"All Scores Double\". This artful repainting could have been done by either the manufacturer or an operator to further distinguish it from a payoff type of machine. The Instruction card appears to have had its text crudely edited by adhesive tape."

Artist Dave Christensen concurred at Pinball Expo 2004 that he intended his Woman in Red to be Sage and no one else.Also on the backglass is a reference to the SMC Cartage Company garage at 2122 North Clark Street, where the St. Valentine's Day Massacre occurred in 1929. When the garage was torn down in 1967, Christensen took some bricks from the site to display on his fireplace mantel.The Biograph Theater operated as a movie house from 1914 until 2004, when it was renovated for live performances.A Hollywood movie, \"Dillinger\", came out in 1973."

		"notes": "General Vending Sales Corporation, a distributor, converted game #2797 into 'Old Hilltop'. The backglass does not carry the Universal name.A Billboard article from December 1951 states Old Hilltop \"is not a conversion, and has all new factory parts, new cabinet, and new wiring color coded to match existing circuits.\" Another article from that month states the game \"is not a refurbished unit. It is factory made with all new parts and new cabinet.\"In contrast with the above industry comments, an actual paid advertisement from General Vending in that same month (shown here) does not say the cabinet is new, while referencing a connection to Universal's 'Winner'. Based on the sole example of Old Hilltop for which we have pictures, the cabinet has the same artwork as Universal's game, identifying the race track it depicts as \"Universal Park\". The playfield is the same for both games with no change in artwork. In fact, underneath the playfield is affixed an inspection tag indicating  \"Universal Industries Inc.\" The backglass design does match the glass of 'Winner' and surely reuses its backbox insert with its identical bulb arrangement.The National Production Authority had placed a quota on steel, copper, and aluminum to be used by manufacturers for 1951, in response to the start of the Korean War. A Billboard article shown here comments on a stricter quota of metals for 1952 (an additional 25% reduction) and suggests that refurbishing games, as was done during WWII, might be an idea to try once again in order to maintain output. Refurbished games, like converted games, typically reused internal mechanisms. In this context, we expect that General Vending's ad intended to impart that they indeed used new internal components and therefore considered their game as neither reburbished nor converted. We wonder how much wiring really needed to be replaced in a source game less than two years old, and in times of materials quota. Even so, placing a new backglass and new name onto a reused cabinet and playfield still makes Old Hilltop a converted game."

		"notes": "'Old Plantation' is a thinly-veiled (but serious) gambling device.  It's essentially a slot machine with a flipperless pinball playfield attached.  When a coin is inserted (or the credit button is pressed), a ball is loaded into the shooter lane, and the three Panascope slot windows on the head unit \"roll\" out a sequence of three symbols. The frequency in which the roll of the Panascope results in a \"winning\" sequence is operator-adjustable via a ten-position dial located to the right just inside the coin door. If a winning sequence appears, the player must shoot the ball to obtain a minimum score to collect the winning credits.  Higher pinball scores advance the value of the winning combination (illuminated columns on the backglass) -- up to 460 credits per game.  Plus, additional credits can be obtained via the pinball portion of the game alone, but this is purposely a near-impossible feat -- the pinball portion of the game is almost a formality, designed to fall within a very narrow score range.  As it is, one-ball mode restricts slot winnings to 93 credits, and two-ball mode awards credits during the second ball, either at the first advance of winning column or at end of ball, whichever occurs first.  So, while it's feasible to reach the highest credit award column in a two-ball game, it verges on the impossible.The player's credits are managed on two sets of reels on the backglass, \"Total Score\" (on left side) and \"Sub Total\" (on right side), while the \"Hi Score\" reels (in the center) are for the pinball playfield scoring.  The number of playable credits is the Total Score minus the Sub Total.  When a credit is used, the Sub Total increments by one.  When credits are awarded, the Total Score is incremented by the appropriate amount as determined by the winning combination of symbols and score level.  Once the two scores are equal, the player is out of credits, and coins must be used again.This machine does not have a payout mechanism to dispense coins or tokens, but operators typically wired in a \"reset\" switch to allow the location to zero out the credit reels after \"cashing out\" the player's credits.  There are no chimes or bells in this machine."

Their typical serial numbering scheme would mean that their last 'On Beam' game would have serial #2150. It appears that the majority were produced having the mushroom bumpers shown in the flyer. However, game owners and hobbyists have reported nine games in the USA and Canada with later-production serial numbers of 2133, 2148, 2178, 2214, 2221, 2271, 2272, 2273, 2285, and 2334, where each playfield has stationary targets instead of the mushroom bumpers. These serial numbers suggest a single, continuous production run of a quantity greater than previously believed, with a changeover from mushroom bumpers to targets somewhere during the run. The reason for this change in design is unknown to us. An example of these \"Later Production\" games is featured below. Several views of it are included for comparative purposes, although the only difference may be the targets.A unique game having serial number #2012 is owned by Federico Croci, a collector in Italy, and its playfield is pictured here. Besides having stationary targets, it's also an add-a-ball version, having no credit unit or credit window in the backglass. The left and right outlanes each have a unique gate to block the ball from draining by diverting it towards the inlane. The game is in storage so we are unable to show backglass and backbox pictures, or show close-up pictures of these gate mechanisms to clarify if/that they were factory-installed. This is the only 'On Beam' that Federico has ever found in Italy."

Game play is standardized at 3 or 5 balls, however, if the player has not had the specified minimum amount of play after his 3 or 5 balls, the game will continue to provide free balls until the minimum time is reached.The backglass is made of a clear protective plastic cover and a rigid translite behind which are raised 3D features.The flyer refers to the spinning bumpers as \"revolving discs\" and the manufacturer's parts list indicates these discs can spin either clockwise or counterclockwise, depending on which of two spinning motors is installed.Click here for an interesting article with photographs about the development of Orbitor 1.'Orbitor 1' was the last pinball machine produced by Stern Electronics. Ted Salveson wrote in his Coin Machine Trader (October 1982, page 2) that the last Orbitor 1 game shipped from the factory on August 10, 1982.

The backglass shows how many points are awarded for reel combinations achieved by the first ball. Free plays (replays) are awarded for high scores and are projected onto the backglass below the owl image. The remaining four balls do not turn the reels but only increase the score, so if the reels did not score well, the four balls can work towards reaching the free play award thresholds.",
		"notes": "'Owl' was designed for territories that would not allow 1-ball games such as Mills' 1940 '\"1 2 3\"'. It was equipped with 5 balls and was promoted that way, but the backbox reels only operated with the first ball of each game, and it was expected that players would likely abandon the remaining four balls and restart the game after only one ball was played. If desired, operators could change to one-ball operation by removing the other four balls from the game.Reportedly, this game was available in both a payout model and a non-payout model, but we have not seen examples with a payout mechanism.The production of 'Owl' began in 1941. This listing includes a Billboard ad from December 17, 1942 stating that the Owl games in that ad were from Mill's \"final production\". We believe that phrasing caused many pinball resources, including ours, to infer a new game was made and thus carry an additional listing for 'Owl' dated December 1942. However, the USA manufacture of pinball machines ceased by May 1, 1942 under orders of the War Production Board, and this ad coming out seven months later certainly was trying to sell leftover games made before the ban. Therefore, we have removed our 1942 listing of this game and moved its images and text into this 1941 listing."

However, what we find in the manufacturer's pictures are not rubbers stretched between two posts as might be expected from the description. Instead, we see several devices that look like the rotating arrow bumpers of later games such as Gottlieb's 1968 'Four Seasons' but we do not know if they function in the same way. These bumpers did appear on Bally games that immediately followed 'Pan-American' so they appear to be a 'new' feature although their appearance two months earlier on Bally's 1941 'Play Ball' may have been Bally's first use of this bumper.The term 'Pan-American' refers to North America, Central America, and South America, collectively. This is reflected in the names of the countries shown on the playfield. The cabinet sides show an aircraft. Pan American World Airlines was a USA-based international airlines that operated from 1927 to 1991."

		"notes": "'Paragon' is the first widebody production game from this manufacturer.The standard version of this playfield has four flippers as shown on the flyer. An unknown quantity of the games shipped to Europe had only three flippers. In this version, a ball guide and a single post replaced the upper right flipper, and the flipper assembly was not installed. In addition, a mini-post was added at the opening beneath the pop bumper in the Beast�s Lair to make it more difficult for the ball to leave the playfield that way.We asked designer Greg Kmiec to comment on why the 3-flipper version was created. He replies:I wouldn't have originally designed Paragon with that lower right section that way because it looks like the pinball could get stuck between those two wire forms. If my memory serves me correctly, I seem to recall that the Italian, French and German markets were quite strong for Bally during that period and Bally was often visited by various foreign distributors.  I recall that they relayed the fact that their players liked to hold the pinball by the flippers.  The way it was relayed to designers through interpreters was that their players liked to hold the pinball on the flipper, take a drink of beer and brag to other players about the skill shot they were about to shoot.  That couldn't be done with the original Paragon design.  I tried something different with Paragon, since it was Bally's first wide-body game. It was relayed to Bally that the foreign player preferred one return lane on each side at the bottom of the game that \"returned\" the pinball to the flippers for a playfield skill shot.  This type of design became known within the industry as the \"Italian Bottom.\"  It was used extensively then throughout the industry and is still in use today.  I do seem to recall adjustments being made to Paragon for foreign games [to have the \"Italian Bottom\"].  I don't recall how many were changed or if they were changed for only one country or one distributor, but they were definitely changed in the factory on the production line.  It might have been due to a combination of two factors: the foreign distributors requesting something their players wanted and Bally realizing a cost reduction on the Bill-Of-Materials by eliminating a flipper. Bally might have been willing to change part of a production run just to sell a new wide-body game.Reportedly, all Paragon games in France have only 3 flippers."

		"notes": "'Planets' had been considered by some as a version of Williams' 1971 'Zodiac' made specifically for Italy. However, Federico Croci, a collector in Italy, reports that he has never seen a 'Planets' game there. He has browsed all of the issues of the two operators-only coin-op magazines of the time, and found no mention of either game.The flyer appears to be an altered 'Zodiac' flyer, still showing a replay window and USA coinage. The full backglass image shown here is the glass from Kordek's office and has no replay window. An actual-size playfield drawing from the manufacturer has surfaced for 'Zodiac' and a portion of it has been scanned for this listing. It shows that 'Planets' was intended for New York distribution.Planets appears to be Zodiac machines that have had their replay units disabled and the backglass changed out at the factory. We note the Model Number is the same for both games. The production run quantity of 704 that Williams documents for Zodiac likely includes Planets.Two examples of 'Planets' are pictured here, each game inexplicably carrying two serial numbers. One game has two tags showing numbers 99486 and 99584. The other game has tags showing 99609 and its cabinet is stamped 99611. These serial numbers fit the range of numbers used in the 'Zodiac' production run. The pictures show certain factory modifications in order to convert the replay game 'Zodiac' into the add-a-ball game 'Planets'. One of the games has pop bumpers that were added after it left the factory. While this playfield is therefore not \"factory original\", we include it here because pictures of this game are hard to locate. We encourage all owners of a 'Planets' to contact us."

However, that game has a very different playfield but does have the Liberty Bell artwork in its upper playfield.The solenoid-operated aluminum Liberty Bell mint vendor was invented by Edmund Fey and was used primarily on slot machines although its design allowed it for use on other devices such as this pinball machine. Its view window was supposed to permanently display five packages of mints to give the impression that the vendor was always full. A nice article from his son Marshall Fey appeared in the October 1985 issue of Loose Change magazine and discussed this invention as well as a 1914 patent for a rotary-piston internal combustion engine, granted to Carl E.

Pro Football was the only game that ever injured me. The story:Since the game was in early production, there was one or two set up in the showroom at Gottlieb. Sometimes after lunch we'd go play these games. What I hated about Pro Football was that the ball could go out the side rollover while the motor was still running because of other scoring. The outlane rollover was very important --- it completed the football \"run\" across the playfield and gave a touchdown score. I am not much of a game pusher or tilter, but I got so frustrated from losing the outlane rollover score that I actually kicked the game. Being an amateur at this, all I did was cause an enormous bruise on my shin. At the same time I vowed that I would never design a feature like that, such a cheat for the player. Of all games for Wayne to ask me to remake! This was my chance to fix this unjust feature. I made no change in the playfield but rather added a delay relay so that the rollover was \"remembered\" until the motor finished. I didn't tell Wayne I was doing it because I was afraid he might veto it on the grounds of adding expense. When he saw the result he was glad I had done it."

However, the Billboard picture ad dated Nov-2-1935 page 67 shows a playfield having fourteen balls on it: five in the captive area and nine others in the regular playfield area. More information is needed to clarify how many balls the manufacturer equipped with this game.All photos in this listing are of the same example of this game. It has five light-blue-colored balls (the captive balls) and six white balls (the ones shot into play). The following description of play utilizes this color distinction:At start of game, all white balls are dropped below the playfield to be ready to be shot into play. Any blue balls in their elevated rack are dumped, but stay on the playfield in the captive ball area. Balls are shot by the player to the upper playfield and if they do not land in any hole there, they line up in a nearby trough, ready to be kicked to the lower playfield. A ball shot into either Loop Starter hole in the upper playfield is returned to the player but also kicks one ball from the trough into the habitrail, rolling it down to the lower left-side automatic kicker lane which then kicks it around a looping lane to the lower playfield holes for scoring.Landing a ball into the Elevated Starter hole in the upper playfield momentarily lights the bulb at center left and returns that ball to the player. It also kicks one blue ball to the upper elevated rack in the captive ball area, where it remains until a new game is started. Each elevated ball in the rack is worth 2000 points.There are no outholes on this game, in the sense that the troughs award points, too. The sole bulb flashes only when the ball drops through the Elevated Starter hole."

All three games have incorrect schematics showing the same error by depicting placement of the flipper end-of-stroke switch on the wrong side of the coil.

The owner stated that the previous owner bought the game from a New Jersey operator who had bought it new and operated it on location. The playfield does not appear to be different than the other examples. We note that the manufacturer's flyer shows a dark backglass, not suggestive of light blue. Of the few serial numbers we know for this production run, serial number 45907 is numerically near the beginning. Because of that and because of the flyer color, we designate this game as Early Production.A better copy of the flyer than the one we show here indicates that the flippers are a dark color which means they came from the factory as red, not white."

		"notes": "When seen in the movie \"Rocky III\", this machine had a prop backglass used only for the movie.  Only three of the prop backglasses were made, and one was destroyed in the film when Paulie, Rocky's brother-in-law, threw a bottle of Scotch through it.  The remaining two are in possession of collectors.We asked designer John Trudeau why the production backglass was not used in the movie. He replies:The coordination with the Rocky III movie was already in process when I started at Gottlieb in '81. Ed Krynski had a whitewood in development for the license tie-in. I guess it didn't play very well, because it never made it to production. The backglasses that were made for the movie were made to fit an existing game - not Rocky (I was told that it was a Force II, but the displays would have to have been moved). The produced game didn't even exist at that time, nor did any artwork. I believe we were pretty close to NOT using the Rocky license at all. I came up with the design that was produced pretty much at the last minute.Later, Stallone was in Chicago promoting the movie's opening. We were told that he might stop by to see the game, but he never showed. I still have my Rocky backglass. The only one I have left that's survived the years.Stallone also did have final approval over the painting for the backglass. Dave Moore had to repaint the facial area twice before it was approved. Sly didn't want the beat-up face for the glass (who can blame him?).Dave Moore did manage to paint himself and me into the crowd. At the foreground right ring post there is a fella with glasses that has his arms crossed (Dave) and another guy next to him with a black moustache and graying temple hair (Me).The cabinet for an engineering sample of \"Rocky\" was reused for the prototype for Gottlieb's 1982 'Gold Rush' and can be seen in that listing.On production games, the cabinet artwork that surrounds the coin door shows a boxing ring along with two symbols that possibly were meant to represent flashbulbs going off in the crowd. On most cabinets, the flashes are black in color, and the \"nearest\" side of the boxing ring is black also, with the remainder of the ring painted in red. We have seen pictures of two games in Europe (not shown here) that have the black and red colors reversed on this cabinet front. We do not know how many of these \"Red Flash Rocky\" games were made.",

Therefore, we have changed the year to 1976, which is when their last EM games were made. It is the only SS pinball machine we have from Sega that carries this style of logo. All their other SS games carry the later style, making 'Rodeo' the apparent first SS pinball machine Sega made."

When hit (when lit), the game says, \"Don't Flip!\", a VUK fires the ball up, through a wireform, and right in front of the flipper, where it sticks on the magnet.  The game says, \"Flip!\", and the ball goes right up the ramp.The \"wall\" ramp shot, when \"ball lock\" is lit, leads the ball down a wireform ramp to a capture area. When 2 balls have been captured and the ball lock is lit, the two balls in the lock area will eject, travel around a circular wireform ramp over the playfield and return to the capture area.  Making the third ball lock begins multi-ball.This game has very addictive background music, with separate tunes for the standard game, 2 ball lock, multi-ball, \"go for the wall\", and jackpot mode.The prototype game shown here, serial number 576X360003, has five drop targets instead of five standup targets. Reportedly, a few production games were made with these drop targets before they were changed to standup targets for the remainder of the production run. In our Files Section is the original ROMs for these drop targets (AD2, for American Drops) from Williams. This prototype game also has the expected red lamp boards under the playfield.Also shown here are pictures of an Early Production backbox, serial number 576I365026, showing a different speaker panel and providing for fifteen flasher bulbs. Very early machines had fifteen #906 flashers in the backbox inserts. They were removed after the samples were made, but Williams used up the harnesses and inserts that they had left. Because of this, there were games with flashers, games with holes for flashers but no sockets and harnesses, and games that didn't have the holes.",

These cabinets had the red and blue reversed from what they should have been. This was corrected during production to show the band name in red letters, a red tongue trademark, and the Union Jack with its proper colors. Artist Greg Freres told us that, when artists did the stencil art, they seldom got to see a proof before production began. He intended the tongue to be red on all games and the cabinet front was intended to be the Union Jack. All the backboxes in the production run are painted the same and Freres believes they are correct to have more red than blue."

Namely, the upper right ball return gate, the right outlane ball return gate, and the center up-post, two of which would affect the number of balls served to the shooter lane. The score cards in the images we have show this game awards extra balls for high scores but, interestingly, the playfield does not have an indicator for Same Player Shoot Again. Perhaps this indicator is silkscreened in the backglass. We don't know if this game allows only one extra ball per ball in play or if it is a two-player add-a-ball, allowing each player to earn more than one ball per ball in play but needing to play them all off before the game changes players. Williams documentation does not indicate that this game is add-a-ball but one of Steve Kordek's many handwritten lists of games partially indicates this. We note that the backglass counts Ball In Play, not Balls To Play as typical of single-player add-a-ball games. If anyone has access to this game to make photographs and/or can provide manufacturer documentation, please contact us."

We were unable to learn if the cabinet has a serial number, often not the case with such games.The games pictured in this listing show two styles of pop bumper caps. Williams used either of these two styles in their games produced from May 1973 to January 1976. We expect that their flyer predicts the style that was used for the entire production run. Most likely, whenever the caps needed to be replaced, operators used whichever style they had handy, as either one would fit on the pop bumper bodies of the games Williams made during this period."

He said cabinet art was always done at the cabinet maker and, as far as he knew, none of the game artists had anything to do with it.Pictured here is a cabinet bottom of a game with serial number 1644 showing a \"brick wall\" design. A similar wood pattern appeared on some cabinet bottoms for Williams' 1980 'Firepower'. Perhaps the same cabinet company was used by both Stern and Williams.Reportedly, this game was also manufactured in Australia by Leisure and Allied Industries under license by Stern Electronics Inc. However, Stern's production data does not indicate any knock-down games were made, which is how other Stern games were exported to Australia.Manufacturer data for Seawitch:Production Start Date: 5/2/80Production End Date: 6/18/80Quantity produced: 2503",

The cabinet's serial number was found obliterated and later painted over. It was likely an operator who reunited this conversion playfield with the original game's backglass and bumper caps, as either a matter of convenience or of necessity, because wartime conversion games became unpopular after the war ended (see \"Portland Arcade Play Off 50% in Peacetime.\", The Billboard, 4 May 1946: 122)."

		"notes": "Although the playfield layout for this conversion kit is identical to Bally's 1978 'Playboy', Sexy Girl was advertised for use on all Bally electronic pins of the time. The kit consisted of a wired playfield, backglass, projector, film cartridge, and instruction manual. Cabinet decals were not mentioned as part of this kit, yet we note that the few cabinets shown here all have the same generic art which did not appear on Bally games. A collector from Germany told us that Arkon did the conversion and repainted the cabinets. Perhaps, then, this manufacturer made Sexy Girl as a converted game, in addition to marketing this as a conversion kit where it is intended for operators to do all the work of converting.There was a Sexy Girl conversion kit made specifically for Bally's 1980 'Silverball Mania' which accounted for the backglass carry-over feature in that game. We show it in a separate listing as Arkon Automaten's 1983 'Sexy Girl (Delux)'.The manufacturer's flyer and some of the games shown here are branded with more than one company name, depending where on the game one looks. We list the company names and where we found them:Backglass:Ranco Automaten A.G. of Thun, SwitzerlandApron:Ranco Automaten A.G. of Thun, SwitzerlandBell Coin Matics of Italy (a maker of conversion kits)Film Cartridge:Ranco Automaten A.G. (blue label only)Arkon Automaten GMBH (both blue and brown labels)Flyer:Arkon Automaten GMBH of Frankfurt, GermanyPinball Vision, a division of Arc, Inc. of Weymouth, Massachusetts, USABecause we know that backglasses and aprons are portable thus can be exchanged between machines, we had been uncertain as to who was the actual manufacturer or if there was more than one. In our Files section is a letter we received in 2005 from Reinhard Deutsch, the inventor of the Picture Pin�, who explained that he owned both Ranco and Arkon companies. He referenced his relationship to Bell Coin Matics and to Pinball Vision. Uwe Burkheiser, the USA distributor for this game, clarified for us the roles the different companies played:Ranco (Switzerland) was Reinhard�s distribution arm for European sales outside of Germany.Pinball Vision (Weymouth US) was the distributor for the Americas and ran by me (living in Boston at the time) as a favour to Reinhard who was bound to Frankfurt/Main � Germany the home of Arkon Automaten GmbH.Reinhard concentrated (with Arkon/Germany) on the modification of the Bally electronics of the conversions (difficult enough at that time) while the backglasses and the aprons where made by either Bell Coin Matics/Italy or a small local supplier to Ranco/Switzerland, which explains their names on these parts.I grant you that the various names may have created confusion in the marketplace. However, the legal setup at that time in Europe required for all these parts the manufacturer to be named on the part � when crossing country borders.From a factual and economic perspective Reinhard Deutsch via Arkon Automaten GmbH, Frankfurt/Main, Germany, was the centre of the wheel and the inventor. All else are administrative or distributive additives/necessities. The manufacturer flyer indicates 200 pin-up images are in this kit. Two cassettes are shown here, one with a blue label and one with a brown label. We do not know if the content differs between them, but a collector counted only 190 images on the film loop in his blue-labeled cassette.Depicted on the backglass is model Ann Pennington from her centerfold pose in Playboy, March 1976."

The relay would be mounted on the lower cabinet board in a vacant space provided for it. It plugs into a nearby 8-pin jack. If this relay was not installed, a shorting plug was necessary in that jack to provide for replay operation.The schematic diagram makes dotted-line reference to an \"Extra Ball Relay\" at locations 10-F and 20-G.

The historic dash inspired two films and the train's nickname, \"Silver Streak\".  The 1934 movie Silver Streak featured the Pioneer Zephyr, but it was renamed and re-lettered Silver Streak for the movie.The original Pioneer Zephyr is currently on display at the Museum of Science and Industry in Chicago."

The sides of the cabinet were made of wood, as was the backbox. The pedestal upon which the backbox connects to the cabinet was made of metal. The serial number is stamped in the wood on the inside of the cabinet near the shooter rod. We asked Wayne Neyens about the metal cabinet. He comments:I think that it was Doc's idea but I forget. It had many draw backs, as I recall it was very noisy, hard to assemble and needed more room than we had available to do the assembly.Wayne refers to Roman F. \"Doc\" Garbark, head of mechanical engineering at Gottlieb.Sinbad (Sindbad) the Sailor was a character in one of the folk tales of classic Arabic literature known collectively as The Thousand and One Nights (aka The Arabian Nights)."

Also, the arrow artwork between the flippers was modified to make the outhole awards more noticeable to the player. As well, the words \"Off Pop Bumpers\" were added to the arrow probably because when the Sample games were at test locations, it was learned that players needed to know that it was normal for the outhole to turn off the pop bumpers."

A small metal Property Tag (\"Prop No. 3238\") is riveted to its cabinet below the right flipper button where the serial number normally would be stamped in production games. The cabinet art matches a later game, Bally's 1971 'Firecracker', but with different colors. Still, the cabinet is original to the prototype because hand-labeled papers are stapled to the inside of it. Note the area around the flippers is unpainted and does not have the black horizontal bars as shown in the second game.The 3-inch flippers shown on this prototype are not the original size of flipper used for this game. Also, the center playfield has a rollunder spinner. This spinner was likely a user modification, as Bally did not put them on their games until 1974.The second game shown here does not have a spinner and does have the expected smaller flippers. It is assumed to be a 'production' game but, interestingly, a serial number could not be found anywhere on it, or in it.Reportedly, 'Six Shooter' is the first Bally game having a motorized trip relay bank, a device Bally didn't use again until Bally's 1968 'RockMakers'."

		"notes": "Skateball reportedly had a faulty design that allowed players to score excessive points, lowering operator profits due to many free games being awarded.  Players could easily hold the ball on the right flipper and make it roll in and out of the right inlane by briefly releasing the flipper button.  This caused the bonus to raise to the maximum award which would award a special upon reaching 60k.  Operators reportedly tried a number of different solutions to solve the problem.We asked artist Greg Freres to tell us about his prototype backglass for this game, called 'Summertime'. He responds:Summertime was a piece of art I did as part of my interview at Bally. Paul Faris asked me to take one week and create a painting that I thought was a good theme and style for pinball. I worked every night until 3 a.m. while still attending my regular job, but I got it done in the allotted time and it was well received by not only Paul but by the sales and marketing group as well. I got the job and the idea sparked the skateboard theme, and some elements stayed for the final art. However, the art was shelved for a few years until we made the game in the early eighties."

Cabinets used at the engineering stage are typically ones available from preceding production runs and the artwork would easily show this. However, we could not identify an earlier game having this Sample cabinet artwork. Instead, we found a game, Williams' 1969 'Expo', made a few months after 'Smart Set' that had this cabinet art design but with different colors. The Sample playfield uses a pink color in the outlanes and in the area of the arrow inserts, as well as inside the helm (ship's steering wheel). This pink color was changed to red sometime during production. The wheel spokes (inside the circle) were drawn as if the outer half of each is made of wood and the inner half is a black line. Sometime during production, all the spokes were changed to be entirely black lines. The game shown in the manufacturer's flyer also shows the pink color and wood spokes. This game shows the cabinet production colors, and the lower cabinet shows the green wave is above the blue wave. In all production games that we have seen, the blue and green colors are reversed in the lower cabinet from what is shown in this flyer.Also pictured here is an example located in South Africa that we have marked as Later Production by virtue of its higher serial number 50774. The playfield pink has been replaced with red and the wheel spokes are fully black. Its lower cabinet colors are reversed from the flyer. The backbox stepper unit inexplicably does not have its bell and clapper. However, the notable difference is that its two bottom standup targets are marked 'Down Post' while the two middle targets are marked 'Up Post'. This is opposite of all other examples shown here. We have seen only one other Smart Set having this target arrangement for its Up-Post feature. This arrangement is not supported by the game manual or by the schematic that we have in this listing.

Later, Ed Suchocki told us that he was the programmer for this game.Two different playfield color schemes have been identified for this game. The differences are found in the color of the sorcerer�s robe and trim, the colors of the feathers on the skull located just above the upper flipper, and the colors of the feathers on the skull located below the upper flipper. We have viewed several playfields and find the two versions can be defined as follows:� Royal purple robe with pink trim. Both skulls have green and red feathers.� Blue robe with red trim. Upper skull has red and white feathers. Lower skull has green, red, and white feathers. We do not know if this represents a change of colors made during the production run or is evidence of two different companies screening the playfield. The sorcerer�s robe extends onto the plastic light shield that covers the center target bank and in all instances this plastic appears to be a dark blue (or han purple) color. Perhaps this suggests the robe was originally blue and then was changed to purple. Our images of an Early Production game are not clear enough to assist this theory. The flyer game shows the royal purple version."

The coin door has a generic art design, in contrast to the cabinet art, and therefore might look like an after-factory replacement. However, Gottlieb was known to do this, and indeed the flyer shows the game with the same generic door. On the back of the coin door is a crayoned '49' that matches a crayoned '49' on the cabinet inside-bottom board. This may be an Inspection number.The owner nicely annotated an image of the Sample serial number. One can see how Gottlieb's automatic indexing stamp worked. It suggests a rather large drum-type metal stamp unit where the numbers rotated on these drums as the serial number increased. It also had the double number prefixes and the game ID letter suffixes (for production games the suffix would be SB). For this sample game, both the prefix numbers and the suffix S (or SB) were indexed out of the way to make blank areas in the stamping. One can clearly see the bottom of an S and the top of a T surrounding the blank area where either the S or SB would be.Also annotated are images of underneath the playfield showing how the ground wire path was first penciled in by Gottlieb engineers before the ground wire was laid down. This is evidence of an Engineering Sample game.The A-B-C inserts in the Sample lower playfield are different than production games. The paper apron cover uses slightly different formatting of text and arrows. Notably, the small 5th ball light was replaced on production games with an elevated Game Over plastic, probably to clarify to the player what it meant when the 5th ball drained from the playfield, as the flippers would still be active at this point. The Game Over relay, which cut power to the flippers, did not appear on Gottlieb games until Gottlieb's 1957 'Royal Flush'."

If the play tilts before the full 50 points are awarded, the score stops accumulating immediately, and a score ending in something other than 00 or 50 is then possible. The match number is always selected from 00 to 90.Credit display maximum is selectable up to 40.",

Its underside has different wiring, with leaf switches instead of micro switches. The owner had obtained it from someone who was parting out a playfield. We notice this mini-playfield appears to be made of the same opaque black plastic as the playfield ramp that leads to the Space Station, and perhaps it is a prototype or sample version that was changed for production. Until we know more, we have labeled it as an alternate version.The translite art shows three space shuttles. Artist Tim Seckel related to us this story: The real space shuttle Challenger blew up right in front of me (January 1986) when I was illustrating the shuttle for this game. I was the only one in the art room at the time and had the TV on. It was terrible and ironic at the same time.

However, it was not their first post-war game, see Chicago Coin's 1945 'Goalee'."

Gottlieb and Company. While Wayne's colleagues predicted a production run of 2,500 games, or 3,000 games, and other numbers in this range, Wayne remained silent. Judd noticed this and asked Wayne to give his prediction of how long the run would last. When Wayne confidently stated the number would be 10,000 games, an amused Judd promised that if it went that high, he personally would deliver one of the games to Wayne's door. Wayne says that the serial numbering of 'Spirit of 76' began at 3001, and it was serial number 13000 that was stamped on the machine that Judd delivered to Wayne in recognition of the 10,000th game produced. It is still the only game that Wayne owns."

		"notes": "'Spirit of 76' was based on Bally's 1974 'Flicker', a prototype, and may be the first digital (non-relay based) pinball machine put into production. Or, that distinction may belong to Allied Leisure's 1975 'Rock On'. The playfield was so unattractive that very few were sold.Interestingly, the playfield design appeared previously on Gottlieb's 1972 'Flying Carpet'.The manufacturer flyer states the sounds are produced by an \"electronic amplifier and quality speaker\" yet shows a game having a chime unit inside its lower cabinet, but possibly the large box in the center of the cabinet is a speaker box to accompany the chimes. There are no holes in the cabinet walls for speaker grills. All of the surviving games for which we have received reports have the chime units, no mention of the large box. These games may or may not have grills mounted in the rear sides of the cabinet, presumably used for sound distribution when they are present, although the chime unit is in the front of the cabinet. The legs are different than the standard size in that they cover almost the full length of the cabinet corners, stopping short of the bottom edge of the metal playfield side rails. All of the playfields have handwritten labels on their undersides.Pictured here is a game (serial number 00109 located on the inside of coin door) with a playfield having unique star-rollover buttons instead of the wire rollovers used on all other known examples. The cabinet was described as made of pressboard. The cabinet legs are standard size, having the tapered \"bolt end\" covering only the lower half of the cabinet corners. The cabinet is painted entirely white and has no cabinet grills or speaker. We do not know how many of 'Spirit of 76' were produced, but with so few of them in evidence, more information is needed to assess if this 109th game is a prototype.The manufacturer's flyer refers to this game as \"The Spirit of '76\" while the score card omits \"The\" from the name. The backglass shows the production name further omits the apostrophe, as \"Spirit of 76\"."

We read in a 1956 article that they did much of the manufacturing of pool games and kiddie rides for Bally Manufacturing, with Lion Manufacturing Company being the parent company of both. The Billboard Ad shows a picture of the game as if it has a flipper button on the cabinet. The playfield images do not show flippers are present. A Billboard article stated \"Stadium features a return to old fashioned body english and introduces ball traps designed to develop play interest.\" A 'return to body english' is a nice way to say there are no flippers. While other manufacturers were making flipper pinballs since 1947, Como didn't try it and neither did Bally, the other Lion subsidiary, except for the two years 1956 and 1957, having otherwise produced throughout the 1950's bingo machines, shuffles, gun games, and the aforementioned games that Como actually made for them."

It is connected to the ball serve lever. This is why the gates stay open only for one ball; each time you push the ball serve the selector gets reset and primed for another spin.When the red coil is activated (by a leaf switch not shown when the ball goes down the 'HATCH'), it releases the sprung selector mechanism. The bar with weights spins.  Now note the coil-like silver thing towards the rear of the mechanism. That is a damper (like you have on a screen door). The spinning part is connected to the shaft connected to the damper such that the shaft coming out of the damper will emerge at a moderately slow speed. Depending on where that damper is when the spinning stops, different leaf switches will be tied together. This is what causes the gates to open and lights to light."

In contrast, the production games we show in this listing each have a USA card holder indicating 'flipper buttons' and, interestingly, does not provide for a Ball In Play counter.

		"notes": "'Star Trek' began as an American science fiction TV series which ran from 1966 to 1969. It was canceled due to low ratings. In syndication, the series' episodes enjoyed a renewed and sustained following which eventually led to a 1979 Hollywood movie of the same name, the first of six movies using the same actors from this TV show.Early versions of the backglass showed the Enterprise crew dressed in the uniforms from the TV series. To promote the Hollywood movie that was coming out at the same time as this game, the backglass art was changed early in the production run to show them dressed in single-color clothing. In addition, two playfield plastics were changed to feature the bald-headed woman from this first movie.These Early Production \"TV version\" backglasses have a large white trademark symbol (TM) after the name. Artist Kevin O'Connor's signature is also shown in white. The modified \"movie version\" glass has a smaller TM in a black color, the artist's name is shown in red, and in the lower right corner is additional license and trademark text not found on the TV version.Also pictured in this listing is a third version of backglass made by Bally but did not appear on any game. It is identical to the movie version except it has no TM after the name. Also, it has no adhesive \"Credit\" sticker in the credit window. It was one of approximately 25-30 glasses that were obtained many years ago from a man who owned a warehouse that was used by Bally. We believe these glasses were considered flawed for lack of the trademark symbol and were set aside by Bally, not to be used on any machine.According to artist Kevin O'Connor, the original backglass art had the character on the left shooting a humanoid, but that had to be changed to a ball of energy due to demands by the show's producers that no one be shown being killed. The humanoid can be seen on the original backglass artwork shown in the book Pinball Art."

Unlimited buy-in balls per player (operator option).There are three cellar holes in the upper half of the playfield. They lead to three VUKs below the playfield that will kick the ball up to the left habitrail or to either of the two cannons on top of the slingshots. To reduce the time it would take for a ball to fall into a cellar hole, roll down under the playfield to a VUK, and resurface back into play, a patented below-the-playfield multiple ball delivery system was developed.  In this system, other balls are already positioned below the playfield, one in each of the three VUKs. As soon as the playfield ball falls into a cellar hole, the corresponding VUK kicks its ball into play. The playfield ball then rolls down to remain in the newly-vacated VUK. Game play is continuous, and time has been saved.Patent #5,350,174 [BELOW THE PLAYFIELD BALL DELIVERY SYSTEM FOR A PINBALL GAME] filed October 28, 1993. Granted September 27, 1994 to Ritchie et al.

Because the 3rd and 4th player score displays would be disabled for this, and likely were not even installed, Stern made a special 2-player backglass for these games. We do not know how many games were shipped with the 2-player backglass.Stern discontinued the 2-player CPU option in subsequent games. The game that preceded this one in production, Stingray, is the other game that had this option, and a 2-player backglass can be seen in that listing.Interestingly, Service Bulletin #8 states that Switch 27 should be set to ON because when set to OFF it will only put one player up, suggesting trouble-free single-player operation. The game manual lists Switch 27 as Not Used. We don�t know the effect this Switch 27, when set to OFF, has on Switch 25 or on any other game operation.Stern programmer Alan McNeil told us that the mini-post screw between the flippers was known as a Kirk Post (for designer Steve Kirk).Manufacturer data for Stars:Production Start Date: 3/17/78Production End Date: 6/27/78Quantity produced: 5127"

The add-a-ball only version of this game is Williams' 1970 '3 Jokers'.The backglass is silkscreened to show 1,000,000 points above the score reels. The backbox insert is equipped with two lamps to illuminate this score. However, the lamp sockets are not wired from the factory, nor is there a 'One Million Relay' installed to light them, therefore this feature does not operate. Only the electrical return path is present, factory-wired from these sockets to a nearby score reel socket. The schematic diagram shows the missing wiring represented by a dashed line for both lamp and relay, and shows an End-Of-Stroke Switch on the 100,000 score reel to have operated the relay via the 9th Position switch. (Williams used the term \"drum unit\" in place of \"score reel\".) The game we investigated had no EOSS on that drum unit. The manual does not mention a 'One Million Relay'. Because we know that other models such as Williams' 1970 'Gay 90's' used dash lines on the schematic to represent an optional \"Extra ball wiring kit\" consisting of a relay cabled to a connector plug, we might have assumed Williams offered this \"One Million\" feature as a kit, although it seems unlikely that the operator would have been expected to install not only the EOSS but also the wiring to this switch and to the lamps, instead of everything pre-wired to a convenient factory-installed cable connector jack. More information is needed to understand why Williams would acknowledge on the schematic this feature that is only partially installed in the game. We note that 1969-1971 was a period of transition for Williams from games with just four score reels to games showing five or six reels, with 'Straight Flush' being one of only four games during this transition that had six reels, until Williams finally settled on five reels in 1971. Williams did not return to six score reels until Williams' 1976 'Aztec'.Interestingly, a Sample 'Straight Flush' backbox insert was found on a '3 Jokers' game, and this insert never had lamp sockets for 1,000,000 points."

The snap trap closes for the remainder of play, and returns its ball to the player. The next time a ball lands in a Free Ride snap trap, it will transfer the ball from the 2000-point hole to the 3000-point hole, and simultaneously will transfer any ball in the 1000-point hole to the newly-vacated 2000-point hole.

When this feature is enabled by the operator, getting a certain number of replays causes the score needed for the first replay to increase for the next game. After a number of games are played without earning more replays, the score needed for a replay decreases. The score needed for the first replay, called the \"lited skill score\" on the score card, lights up in one of five colored areas in the lower left portion of the backglass.This feature is controlled by a separate step unit in the backbox that increments in step with the replay unit and decrements a step each time a replay is played off. If the feature is disabled by the operator, the five colored areas will not light and the first replay will always occur at some fixed score. A different score card will then be used, one that does not make reference to a \"lited skill score\".Handicap Scoring is an unusual feature for an electromechanical pin game. A more sophisticated version appeared in solid state games starting with Williams' 1986 'High Speed' and was referred to as Auto-percentaging. If anyone has internal access to this game, please contact us with your photographs. We hope to document the operational details of this feature."

One image shown here has a small hole in the replay window area.Several examples of this game have been reported to us as missing the light socket and wiring on the backbox insert which would have illuminated the red buffalo silkscreened under the first-player score, the apparent target of the rifleman on horseback. The reason for this omission was that the manufacturer placed the replay adjustment score plug assembly to block the hole where the lamp would go. We have two images which show this, from the game with serial number 05530. We do not know if all 'Sunset' games had this issue."

I think it was 3,000, but Eugene might remember a different quantity.  It might have as high as 5,000......  Eugene wrote all the sounds for Superman and one of his amazing programs that created some sounds by introducing bugs to the program.  He later created G-wave, an incredible breakthrough at the time.  Recording music and sound on silicon was not an option in 1977.      Eugene and I worked together on Superman for what seemed like years.  It might have been 13 months or so.  I stumbled through many whitewoods, but ultimately, it played nice for it's time.  I brought my Echoplex (a guitar player's tape loop mechanical echo chamber on the cheap) to work, and connected it to our Superman Prototype.  The continuous background sound that emanated intrigued us.  Atari management refused to let us apply this fun discovery, which made the player feel more a part of the pinball game, and added progressive adrenaline to any pinball as the game progressed.  Why didn't management feel what we felt?I left Atari to make pinball machines at Williams before Superman was manufactured, and applied the background sound concept to Flash, which was also the first game to use Flash Lamps, (that's how they got their name) and a 3rd-flipper-repeatable loop shot.  I was also a lot happier working at Williams, happiness being an important ingredient that enables a designer to create to his/her potential."

This may have been a change during production or a correction by the cabinet maker.Users have commented that they have seen more examples of 'Surf Champ' back in the 1970s (and subsequently) than one would expect to have seen for a game with a production run quantity of 1,071 units. While this quantity has been confirmed with data provided by Gottlieb, it is a relatively low number when compared to quantities made of Gottlieb's other 4-player games of 1976. That alone does not prove anything, but serial numbers of 'Surf Champ' compiled by users indicate a quantity of over 4,000 units were actually made.

There were no lamps or other special lights mounted inside to shine through these inserts. We asked designer John Borg if special lighting was intended and if any of these backboxes made it into production. He replied:I believe I had some GI and flash in the backbox. It would cast a haze on the big molded topper. Costed out (was eliminated) before production. I had one of the early 30 or so prototypes and don�t remember if my game had these inserts added to the top of the backbox or not. I�m thinking not. [The game pictured] must have been an engineering sample they sold.We asked Lyman Sheats if he participated in this game.

He replies:Suffice it to say that we did have some limited run of machines featuring a 'blonde Marilyn' � and I don�t know if these were for international only. However, we were informed that there were rights that needed to be secured in order to use Marilyn and the decision was made to just alter the artwork so that the female character was renamed �Lola� for the main production run. If memory serves, and I can�t say with certainty�there might be games that were manufactured with a brunette Lola and then a redheaded Lola.The changes needed to introduce 'Lola' include backglass art, playfield art, game software, and instruction card.According to Mark Ritchie, as explained in the book The Pinball Compendium 1982 to Present, at least 200 sample games were in the process of being shipped with 'Marilyn' before the change had to be made. He also explained the name 'Lola' was taken from a 1970s song about a transvestite, chosen to befit her muscular arms as depicted on the backglass.Marilyn's face appears twice on the playfield: directly below the center drop target bank and also as an illuminating insert further down. We have seen one instance of the Lola playfield where she was still blonde near the drop targets but was a brunette in the insert. We don't know how many playfields were made this way.",

With the game still in development, by the time the DMD programming was finalizing (which happens after the artwork), the liquid T-1000 was already public knowledge, which allowed the character to be included in the display animation.

Specifically, the backbox is tagged '3 Jokers' as serial number 65382 while its insert is tagged as a Sample 'Straight Flush' with handwritten number 70 (or 76). The lower cabinet is tagged '3 Jokers' as serial number 65384 while its motor board is tagged as a Sample 'Straight Flush' with handwritten number 61. Although the backbox replay unit is operational and can award replays, the '3 Jokers' backglass correctly does not have a replay window on it, thus the game mode on the 'Straight Flush' backbox insert has been set to Add-a-Ball.  The cabinet serial numbers on this game do not fall numerically close to the few other serial numbers we have for the production version but instead fall within the known number range of an earlier game 4 Aces from March 1970, suggesting the cabinet was created around that time. We can only theorize that Williams purposely placed Sample backbox inserts from Straight Flush into a '3 Jokers' game. This theory is supported by the fact that the Sample tags, while having different two-digit numbers between them, each have '3J-(4)' written on them, which might suggest this was the fourth '3 Jokers' sample game. Until we receive a better explanation for this data, we will mark these game images as Sample Game.The production game pictured in this listing also has a replay unit minus the replay wheel and this unit is likely disabled. We suspect others in this production run are equipped the same."

Bally was the first manufacturer to acknowledge this growing practice by placing a score card on '3-Ring Circus' direct from the factory, mounted in a wood marquee. The flyer for this game indicates the score card is used for location payouts and that this card can be removed to convert the game to a \"straight pin\".We note that this game from July 1932 is not the first appearance of a factory marquee, as we have found games dated as early as February 1932 having marquees that are mostly small and made of metal. The largest of these earlier marquees appears on Mills' 1932 'English'.The Billboard ad shown here was placed by Bally and the image it displays is identical to the image in a Billboard ad appearing a week later but placed by Rock-Ola Manufacturing Company.See Rock-ola's 1932 '3-Ring Circus'Bally is the well-documented maker of '3-Ring Circus'. Until we know how to tell the difference between the Bally version and the apparent Rock-Ola version, all unbranded images of this game will be placed in this Bally listing."

We can trace ownership of this particular game back to 1980 in Germany, and the insert was present then, thus we figure it was added by a operator sometime in the 1970s.Also pictured in this listing are two backglasses showing the game name in white lettering, instead of red. The dresses of the three majorettes also are white, instead of red. One glass was reported to us as an alternate version. However, backglasses of this period were notorious for the red pigment washing out into a white color. Yet, other prominent red areas on these backglasses seemed to remain intact. More information is needed to possibly clarify this, including pictures of higher-resolution and/or close-up pictures of the dress areas."

A spinning target marks each end of a large horseshoe lane that runs under a raised center ramp. A fast ball in the horseshoe lane comes out the other side. A slower ball might disappear under the ramp and exit play. A timed multi-ball mode allows up to six balls in play. A second button on each side of the cabinet next to the flipper buttons gives the player the choice of ball entry onto the playfield to either the left or right flipper.

John Kotlarik did the Speech Processing for this gameJames T. Hawes, technical writer and technical support technician at Williams, wrote content for and assisted in the design of four backbox toppers for this game. He contracted with a local art studio for the final pieces. They were a simple tent-shaped sign made of Fome-Cor. The front showed multi-colored \"bullet points\" (text) on a black background.Hawes was firm in his recollection that there were exactly four toppers made, to promote four test games that were put out on location, one topper for each, but he believes Williams likely made engineering samples of Thunderball as well.",

Our distributors were requesting a pin design where play time can be better managed and for the game to be cost reduced..Time Fantasy was designed as a two-player unit and had most of the coils removed. Plasma displays and coils were the most costly items on the playfield so they were limited. We also had a need to get a game ready for the factory in less than three weeks time, otherwise the factory was looking at being shutdown. Williams did not like shutting down the line and wanted to keep people working. We were placing our emphasis on the development of video games at that time and we had limited programmers available.Besides Larry Demar, I was probably the most familiar with the pinball operating system at that time. The design team was able to complete the game in two weeks which gave us some leeway in getting playfields, artwork, and testing in before production. Testing was interesting and showed us something we didn't expect. The game was  played by an older audience. We were told that parents were playing the game while their children played all the ticket vending machines.It tested well in the family centers but it didn't do so well in the locations for hardcore gamers. I do remember there was an earnings report showing the game made over $500 for a week in one location. However, it just wasn't mainstream and didn't perform well in all locations."

		"notes": "10 pre-production prototypes were made for promotional use in conjunction with the off-Broadway productions. These prototypes had six pop bumpers. The game made its debut at the Hard Rock Cafe in Dallas in October of 1993, one of these games fell off the truck and was destroyed.  Another was used in the 1993 Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade, this special machine was rigged for \"autoplay\" and had no backbox, electronics were cabinet-mounted. Reportedly, these prototypes may have had EM chime units.Pictured in this listing is a game with 3 pop bumpers and which has a playfield matching the one in the manufacturer�s flyer, showing the Union Jack with fat white stripes and the hard-to-read Acid Queen inserts, two details that were changed for production games. The inside of the cabinet is tagged �S/N P7.103� and the upper playfield has a plain white airplane with markings on it. We contacted Eric Winston, one of the Data East tech engineers who brought Tommy to life, for his comments. He did not specifically recall this game or the white airplane but he did say that the 'P' on the airplane meant 'prototype' and the 545-5483-00 is a part number, and the signature below it would be Ed Cebula who would sign off on the part. He did not know if the serial number P7.103 meant a prototype but after seeing the bare metal habitrails on this playfield instead of chromed production ones, he offered his best belief that the serial number was a 'cabinet prototype number'. Considering also the white airplane, the Acid Queen inserts, and the pre-production Union Jack, Eric said that everything points to believing this is a prototype game. We note the manufacturer sticker on the back of the game shows a serial number 103046 which is early in the run but not the earliest number. Eric said the export games went to Germany to Bally Wulff and that the green tag on the cabinet front is an operator. This tag carries Dutch language and a date of '07 februari 1994'. The game is located in the Netherlands. We have categorized this game with its 3 pop bumper design as a prototype.We previously listed the Manufacture Date as January, 1994 (no day specified).This game was produced from Jan-8-1994 to Apr-9-1994.We previously indicated a production run quantity of 3,500 units.We received a report of a game in Austria having a date of Jan-4-1994 which is prior to the Jan-8-1994 date provided by the manufacturer. Unfortunately, the report was sent anonymously so we cannot confirm this.",

		"notes": "Production start date: 03/18/48Production end date: 05/03/48The photographs in this listing show that this game was produced in two different cabinet styles, each with its own art theme. One cabinet is painted with a three-color rainbow and stars, and its side rails extend a few inches behind the backglass. We presume this cabinet style came first because its art and this \"side rail juncture\" match that of Genco�s previous game, Triple Action. Because the artwork resembles feather plumage and these feathers appears on each cabinet face, for ease of discussion we will refer to this cabinet as the \"Feathers\" cabinet.The other cabinet is painted with simple geometric designs. The side rails do not extend behind the backglass. We presume this style came next because its art and side rail juncture match the two games Genco made after this one, Mardi Gras and Merry Widow (and probably the games beyond that). The backboxes are taller on this cabinet style and the Trade Winds backglasses mounted in them are taller as well, having a blue band of silkscreened paint at their tops and bottoms to make up for the extra space needed. The band at the top is slightly discernible at close view from the blue sky in the artwork. The inside measurements of the wood trim that frames this larger backglass are 21 1/2 inches high by 19 1/2 inches wide. These cabinets have not been repainted. Because the artwork has three circles, or dots, that appear on each cabinet face, for ease of discussion we will refer to this cabinet as the \"Dots\" cabinet.Measurements of these two cabinet versions are as follows:Backbox - measured edge to edge but not including any trim:Feathers: 21 3/4 inches wide, 28 1/2 inches high, and 9 inches deep.Dots: 22 1/4 inches wide, 30 5/8 inches high, and 9 inches deep.Wood backbox insert (holds all the mechanics) measured edge to edge:Feathers: 20 inches high and 20 inches wide (square).Dots: 22 inches high and 19 3/4 inches wide.Lower cabinet - measured from edge to edge and not including any trim:Feathers: 21 inches wide, 43 3/16 inches long, 12 inches high in front, and 14 1/2 inches high in back.Dots: 22 inches wide, 42 3/16 inches long, 12 inches high in front, and 14 1/2 inches high in back.Playfield - removed from the game, measured from edge to edge:Feathers: 19 3/8 inches wide and 41 3/8 inches long.Dots: 20 3/8 inches wide and 40 1/8 inches long.Legs: metal adjustable feet not included:Feathers: 32 1/2 inches long.Dots: 31 inches long.Note: It is assumed the legs are original to each machine. With longer legs on the shorter backbox, and shorter legs on the longer backbox, the top of the backboxes are the same height.Because the Dots playfield is wider than the Feathers playfield, there is extra space between the side bumpers and the wood playfield walls, and each outside rollover at mid-playfield has two extra posts to define the lane. Because the Feathers playfield is longer than the Dots playfield, there is extra space between the upper ball arch and the top-most bumper. The coin doors are a different size and thus are not interchangeable between cabinets.An apparent third cabinet style is shown in the Coin Box ad in this listing. It shows the cabinet artwork and the shorter backbox of the Feathers version yet features the side rail juncture of the Dots version. We have not yet seen actual games that match this style, and we note that the game shown in this ad is not a photograph but an artful and realistic drawing. This ad appeared in that trade magazine in April 1948, the month that the game was first available from distributors.We don�t know the reason why Genco would change the backbox and cabinet size during this production run or how many games were made in each of the two versions for which we have photographs. A theory is that, due to unanticipated demand, Genco extended the production run but then had to migrate to the different size backbox and cabinet that was intended for the next models, necessitating a revamped playfield with the extra space, and making larger backglasses by adding the blue bands to the existing art instead of paying the artist a second time.  This theory presumes that new cabinets were in the pipeline anyway, and then the question becomes why change cabinet styles at all? The larger backbox of the Dots cabinet might have been needed to support new or larger backbox components that were planned for subsequent games. More internal backbox pictures would be useful to have for the Dots version and for the two Genco games that followed, Mardi Gras or Merry Widow, to further investigate if the increase in backbox size can be supported by anything we find.We present pictures of the Feathers cabinet and the Dots cabinet placed side-by-side for comparison.The owner of the Feathers game with pictures attributed to Kochever tells us that the silver color that is on the inside cabinet walls visible on each side of the playfield and above its top edge is silver spray paint applied by a previous owner. Under the silver is yellow paint. In the backbox of this particular game is a bell or chime unit in a white plastic case. Its leads are soldered to the terminals of the replay unit step-up coil below it, such that when a replay is added, this sound device is activated, if only for the duration of the coil step. With two bells nearby, this unit looks like an after-factory addition by an operator, taking advantage of the unused area of the insert. To the left of this chime box is a coil assembly, including five jacks, mounted to the left of the chime unit, and this assembly is not present in our shorter backbox picture. The owner believes this is the coin door lockout coil, moved to the backbox using plain white wiring when the game was taken off route and sold as a home use machine, and retained to facilitate starting the machine for each game play."

We have no information on this artist, and designer Mike Kubin did not recall who it was, telling us that, at that time, George Molentin from Advertising Posters used to do the presentations. They would go over the artwork, then George would make notes and  have the changes made.

However, this \"third knob\" is not seen on any of the actual photographs of this game that we have encountered. It�s possible that the knob was drawn by an artist and did not find its way to production. If it was exclusive to Model 1, then all photographs would have to be of Model 2 unless the knob was removed sometime during production of Model 1. We invite additional information from owners of Triumph and whether your game is limited to two buy-backs or has all five. From this beginning, we may discover how to identify a given picture as Model 1 or Model 2.See also Bally's 1940 'Triumph (Model 2)'."

		"notes": "This game was part of Williams/Midway's \"SuperPin\" line of widebody games.Voice-over artist Tim Kitzrow provided the voice of Rod Serling.Rod Serling's likeness had to be licensed separately from the \"Twilight Zone\" name.Retrofit instructions for third playfield magnet (removed in production games) available here.An article by Ted Estes about designing Twilight Zone is available at GameRoom Magazine.Another article shows differences between prototype and production games. Here is an Italian language translation.Twilight Zone was originally to be the first game to use Williams' then-new DCS Sound System (which would actually be introduced for Williams' 1993 'Indiana Jones: The Pinball Adventure'), but due to time constraints concerning the production of the DCS board, the music was recomposed for the Yamaha YM2151/Harris CVSD audio board.  It is also therefore the last game to use that audio board.We asked Chris Granner to tell us about the music for this game. He replies:The main play tune for TZ is a WPC (synthesized) version of the loooonnnng guitar solo section from Golden Earring's \"Twilight Zone\". The Jackpot tune is a WPC version of the CHORUS of that song, where you hear the main melody of the song. There are snippets and takeoffs from dozens of TV show moments, way too many to list.  The actual AUDIO from either of these sources is NOT reproduced in TZ pinball.In this listing is an image of a playfield under blacklighting, revealing a serial number. We asked Pat Lawlor why the manufacturer did this. He replies:The reason for the serial numbers seems strange by today's standards. In 1992, Williams' agreement with its distributors gave them exclusive sales right to a territory. They did not have the right to sell outside of their territory. But some were doing just that. In order to track the game's origin from a distributor into the wild, the blacklight number was added. Williams knew where the game was originally shipped. If the game turned up outside of that territory, it was assumed that the distributor had \"Bootlegged\" the game outside of his territory. Then it was up to management to decide what penalty to incur on the offender. Remember, this was during a time when it was PROFITABLE to sell and operate pinball machines. This practice would be laughable today because ANY sale of a pinball machine is a good sale.",

In some production glasses, the area below the score reels alternate between green and yellow-green, the stripes are yellow-green instead of yellow, and the three stars are also yellow-green. Even if allowing for color variations in flyer printing and/or camera processing, or differences with lighting used when the games were photographed, these color differences appear discrete and suggest more than one color set was made during backglass production. However, based on the game shown here having serial number 05430, we cannot say with confidence that production games with backglasses that match the flyer are Early Production. Other explanations for these color variations are possible.'2001', its add-a-ball version 'Dimension', and the add-a-ball export version 'Galaxie', all made by Gottlieb in 1971, are the first pinball machines to feature multiple banks of drop targets."

The word \"Vitrigraph\" appears near the outhole.2) A silkscreened playfield with lighter trapezoids. 3) A silkscreened playfield with darker trapezoids.We asked John Trudeau if he might recall the reason for these different \"versions\". He replies:I am not sure, but I believe Premier cut off the \"Vitrigraph\" process in the middle of the production run due to problems in the field. I think the stoppage was done in either TX Sector or Diamond Lady. I can't remember which. That would explain the differences in the colors, I believe. Other than that, I am not aware of any production color changes that were made.There may have been a hiccup in the production of the [silkscreened] playfields.  I am sure there was never a conscious effort to change the art once it was in production (that would only have incurred more cost).  There could have been a screen that needed to be repaired at some point in production.  And, I don't think there were any actual changes in the vendors doing the screening.John later confirmed to us that TX Sector, Premier's 1988 'Diamond Lady', and Premier's 1987 'Victory' were the only games to have Vitrigraph playfields, a process he believes was solely developed by Premier and not used by other pinball manufacturers."

(The ball does not pass between the two playfields.) The lower playfield is visible through a window in the upper playfield.Both playfields are tilted away from the player and viewed through a mirror. The mirror is mounted at eye-level, so the illusion is presented that the ball is moving about on a vertical playfield. The mirror is only partially silvered and the score displays are mounted behind it. Also mounted behind the mirror are some flash lamps behind a screened plastic. The effect of the flash lamps when they fire is to overlay lightning bolts over the reflected image of the playfield.The playfield on Varkon is a combination of wood and plexiglass. The plexiglass overlays the wood, and is screened with artwork.\""

		"notes": "Artist Greg Freres offers some interesting information about the evolution of a design team:Vector was a bit of an experiment when it came to the design philosophy at that time. We were in the midst of trying to save pinball from the video monster and I'm not sure who it was, but the idea of working as a complete \"team\" was introduced as a concept to hopefully improve upon the design from the ground up by allowing more ideas to flow into the process. Before this the design group would build whitewoods, play them, tweak them, and then decide which of them would become the next game. Some of the games had more input from art or marketing from the inception, like Xenon, but for the most part the games would get blessed by Norm [Clark], etc and get sent to the art department for the finished theme and package. With Vector, I recall having meetings with a team of maybe five to ten people, including Greg Kmiec and people from other areas, maybe sound, mechanical, and electrical included (?). Greg was the project leader and we all brainstormed together to come up with unique features, the theme, and other design elements.Greg Kmiec summed it up this way:Bally tried an experiment of \"team designing\" games.  Each team had a designer, programmer, artist and solid state/sound person on it.  The goal was to design a game with everyone's input.  I remember that VECTOR was one of the games that came out of the team design concept because I was the designer on that team.  As you can tell by the number of features on it, VECTOR was indeed designed by committee.  The experiment was abandoned after each team's first game.The 1982 Bally/Midway pinball parts catalog page 41 indicates the top flipper is the same part number and uses the same size rubber ring as the two 3-inch flippers at the bottom of the playfield. However, every game we have seen has the shorter 2-inch size for this top flipper (and a smaller ring). We asked designer Greg Kmiec if ever a 3-inch flipper was intended, or if changes were made during production. He confirmed his original playfield drawing has a small flipper in this upper playfield location.  He said that a larger flipper would somewhat inhibit the pinball from entering the upper playfield and provide too much power shooting at the nearby targets.  He does not remember changing his original design to a larger flipper anytime during the production run. From this, it appears the parts manual is in error to indicate the top flipper is the same size as the bottom flippers."

In 1935, her son, Joseph G. Westerhaus II (1911-1989), quit his job with a bakery company and began working full time for his mother in the business. In 1941, she moved her operations, likely to a new building less than half a mile away, at 3726 Kessen Avenue, built that year. In 1942, Frances and Joe II formed a partnership, calling it Westerhaus Amusement Company, and they began making pinball conversion games at the Kessen address. Westerhaus Amusement split off the pinball manufacturing portion in 1945 into a new company, Westerhaus Manufacturing Company, and the Amusement Company then functioned only as an operator, and finally incorporated on November 1, 1946. After the war, Frances and Joe II formed Royal Distributing Company as a jobbing and distributing outlet for the Cincinnati Ohio area. Frances died in 1953. The eventual President of Royal Distributing Company was Joseph G. Westerhaus III (1938-2008) but everyone called him Joe Jr. Westerhaus Amusement became Pioneer Vending, still at 3726 Kessen, and today is owned by Bill Westerhaus, half-brother of Joe Jr."

These were done as a standard silkscreen on the wood, with an overlay of clear mylar.

Another game with this playfield was located in Europe and had a cardholder with the center circle showing a lions head above the name L�WEN, the trade name for NSM Lions. While NSM Lions has manufactured copies of Mylstar's The Games and Premier's Tag Team Pinball, we do not know if they made a copy of the Victory game.The whitewood of this game had a small playfield below the main playfield. John Trudeau tells us more about this fated whitewood design:I also tried to put a race car on a track that would advance when the player got to the next level down there. That turned out to be as expensive as the lower level pinball playfield. So neither were used."

The flyer shows the production version.The sample game shown here with serial number '01016 S' uses a plastic playfield overlay glued to particle board. In one image, the overlay is shown as falling a half-inch short of the edge of the board. The game owner was not sure if this half-inch margin appeared on all edges of the playfield.Tim Arnold contacted us with the following information for 'Volley', 1977 'Big Hit', and 1977 'Jacks Open':I have noticed a mystery on these three games I can solve for you. I have had many examples of these machines over the years. Playfields with PAINT over [flipper] swipe area and top arch are made of CHIPBOARD! I first saw this at Cleveland Coin back in the day when we were thinking of buying the game off the floor. Our salesman told us to take one in the box as the painted over area was \"Pressed wood\". I later talked to Cliff Strain [in Sales] at an annual trade show. He told me they were trying new materials because of a spike in the price of plywood. I have had two of these three machines since then, and the paint seems to stick to the wood just fine, but the surface turns rough and bumpley (sic) under the paint."

		"notes": "Allan Reizman, Engineering Lab Supervisor at Bally 1977-1983, tells us that some examples of Voltan were used to test a newly developed AS-2518-51 sound module. We asked him to tell us the story around it, to explain how it was different from what Voltan already had, and how owners could recognize one of these prototyped games. He responds:As you noted Voltan was produced with original analog sound board AS-2518-04.  As you noted, the manual explains the limited settings with the dip switches, sounds, no sounds, or chime bells only. After Williams introduced Flash with its electronic programmable sounds and background sound effects, Bally quickly developed its own microprocessor controlled sound board. That board was introduced in Future Spa and was later incorporated into the Squawk and Talk speech board.Before we put that sound into production I led a research project to determine the effect of electronic sounds on the cashbox earnings of the game. We chose to experiment on Voltan because the game was performing poorly and was not scheduled to be further produced beyond its 330 game pilot run. I had a lab game and 2 maybe 4 field games modified by removing the analog sound card and replacing with the newly designed 6808 microprocessor card. These games were located at Aladdin�s Castle arcades in the Chicago area that were owned by Bally.My audio engineers hastily re-programmed the game for psychedelic electronic sounds replacing the crude analog notes with sci-fi like effect, worthy of science fiction. Interestingly, we chose not to include a background effect as to not tip off Williams we were going to have that with our next production game.After the modifications were complete, I monitored the previous and following 30 days of collections to determine if the sound upgrade would have an effect. The results showed a modest increase in plays. This was enough of an improvement, considering the poor earnings performance of Voltan, to justify the production of that sound system.The upgraded Voltans are identified by having the newer style sound board and special unlisted PROMS on the mother board. They were never de-modified although I left the old sound board and chips in the game should Aladdin�s have decided otherwise. I know there are at least 3 of these games in existence and possibly a fourth."

The van is the kind of thing I would draw in geometry class back in high school so it came easy. We've always had English Setters so the dog is a cartoony version of an goofy setter. This was my first game with Pat Lawlor and the first appearance of the 'hand on the button' which became a recurring theme. I think the rough sketches showed the driver giving a thumbs up but Pat dreamed up the 'hand/button' idea as well as the tag line 'any time� any where' on the truck. We were both Chicago Cubs baseball fans so the original painting shows the kid in the truck wearing a Cubs hat and the first run of translites were printed that way. The legal guys frowned on it so a sticker was applied to the first run translites, covering the Cubs 'C' with a William's 'W', until new translites were made with the \"W\" on the cap.",

Yet, we also show an ad from the same issue of that magazine where In and Outdoor Games clearly label themselves as manufacturer, even if their reference to their factory could be explained as a marketing reference to Midway's factory.Pictured here are two different cabinet fronts for this game. Based on the dates of the ads shown in this listing, the version advertised first (Mar-28-1931) had a coin drop on the top and the external ball trough on the front. The September 1931 ad and the 1932 ads presented a version with a coin slide on the front and the ball trough on the cabinet right side. It could be assumed one version replaced the other, but a 1933 ad again shows the first version. With either style, the player manually transfers each ball from the trough to the feeder hole on the top right side of the cabinet so that it falls in place in front of the ball shooter. At the rear of the cabinet is an alternate feeder hole to insert the ball into play at the top of the playfield, directly above five pins there, arranged as a pocket. The ball lands in this pocket, then the player operates a knob at the rear of the cabinet to lower these five pins into the playfield, releasing the ball into play.The bagatelle version is In and Outdoor Games' 1932 'Whoopee Game'."

		"notes": "The manufacturer produced the backglasses in both crystal glass and Plexiglas.A factory add-a-ball version of this game was located in France having serial number 3022. The backglass and playfield are no different than the replay version. It was factory-wired with an add-a-ball stepper unit in addition to the standard replay stepper unit . There is no option to switch between replay and add-a-ball modes; the replay unit operates only to register multiple credits when a coin is inserted.  The add-a-ball unit is not a kit and is mounted in the backbox in place of the 0-9 unit (match unit), assisted by two add-a-ball relays mounted nearby. Because there is no 0-9 unit, each player�s \"ones\" score reel is not wired for match operation at end of game. The silkscreened match numbers 1 through 9 on the backglass are used to count the added balls, leaving the number 0 not wired.  Added balls are awarded for high scores (in multiples of 1000 points only) and for Wiggler Jet Super Bonus scores. Each player can earn up to 9 balls during the ball in play, and all added balls must be played off by that player before the next player is up. The Same Player Shoot Again indicators remain lit continuously for a player from the moment the first added ball is earned until the last added ball is shot into play. We don't know how many games were wired this way. No reference to this version has been found in the Bally Parts Catalogs.A special version was produced for Germany and was named just 'Wiggler'. Both versions had the same project number and project release date.  The US version schematic part number is W-1042-41a and the German version is W-1042-42a."

		"notes": "'Wisconsin' was the first flipper game made by United.Pictured in this listing is a game that appears to have been converted not once, but twice, by an operator. The first conversion would have changed the cabinet from a standard game into a rolldown game by using screws to attach thick wood rails to the sides and front of the cabinet to allow for the two-level playfield glasses for rolldown play. A rolldown version of the playfield was installed which has no curved wooden upper ball arch. The shooter lane would have been blocked at its top end, and a ball cup installed in place of the spring-loaded ball shooter. The second conversion would change the game from rolldown back to a standard game. The thick siderails were left in place, but the small playfield glass was removed and the larger lower glass was pushed forward, leaving an open gap between the lockdown rail and this glass. The spring-loaded ball shooter was re-installed. Because the rolldown playfield was retained and does not have an upper curved wooden ball arch, a short curved metal strip had been placed at the top of the shooter lane. We have marked the images of this game as a \"Rolldown Re-conversion\" and present them as an example of what changes the operators might make."

We have added a Service Bulletin dated 28 March 1978 which references ROMS 9008 and 9008-1 but does not explain the above information.Production Floor Records for World Cup:Production Start Date: May-1-1978Production End Date: Aug-14-1978Production Floor Quantity: 6253Official Records for World Cup:Quantity produced for USA/Canada: 3621Quantity produced for export: 2829Total quantity produced: 6450Price to Distributor: $1235.00"

A Grand Slam Home Run adds 1 letter to the name WORLD SERIES on the backglass. This is a carry-over feature from game to game and awards 5 replays upon completion (operator enabled). The match feature is operator adjustable for either of these two modes:Mystery Match - this is the traditional operation where a random match number lights up at the end of the game, awarding a replay if it matches the last digit of the score.Skill Match - the match number is illuminated throughout game play, changing constantly as the 0-9 unit advances. This changing number gives no award during play, but its visibility allows the player an additional strategy if the game play is on the last inning with 2 outs. Then, once the changing match number agrees with the last digit of the score, the player can purposely try to score the 3rd out to end the game in order to win the match award. However, the player might not want to end the game in this way if the scores are close to winning replays for runs or for beating high score.Sound: 2 bells, knocker."

		"notes": "First prototype game was a narrow-body game.  Game kept changing as wrestlers left WWF for other organizations.  Many custom voice samples from wrestlers.Included in this listing are pictures of an Early Production game. The apparent differences from later production games are itemized below, and seem to be evident in the flyer:1) The plastic above the ramp in the upper left playfield indicates 'Lite Mode Start' instead of 'Banzai'.2) The wide plastic along the back wall of the playfield does not have the yellow banner indicating 'Let's Rumble'.3) The mini-playfield has the text 'Increase Jackpot' on the wood above a red insert instead of having the words 'Multi Ball' appearing directly on the red insert.This Early Production example has mylar that was rough-cut. If this mylar was really hand-cut at the factory, it could indicate this machine was a prototype of sorts. Its serial number was not obtained to assist in identification. This machine has French coin chutes possibly pointing to its first export destination.Also pictured in this listing is a game identified by Orin Day as a Test Game, having the Early Production plastics as listed above and also having three large round magnets in the lower playfield area that were to activate during multiball. The playfield was missing a bank of standup targets and three screw holes underneath showed the targets were once there but had been removed, with wires clipped, and aligned with the vacant hole were six factory dimples, each highlighted with a red marker pen. When we first showed the pictures to Orin, we asked him if this was an Early Production game and, if so, why were the magnets removed during production? He replied:My recollection is that early WWF games did have the magnets, like many DE games of that era. I know we removed them, pretty sure the reason was that they gave little bang for the buck in the game, especially with there already being a powerful shaker motor on board. Looking at those pictures the red Sharpie by the missing stand-up targets makes me suspect that this was a test game, one of the first five or six made, but that's just a hunch. I am pretty sure that the magnet code was present in the CPU software but I don't have the game code or display code to check for sure. And silly me, I don't own a WWF. :) I agree that the plastic changes indicate that it was at least one of the first 100 games. Quite often our earliest test games had \"homemade\" lettering on some ramp signs, but they were usually updated when they came back to our shop.My recollection also is that due to some weird Japanese import law we had to have the same number of magnets and motors in every game for that year, so Japanese games might have had the magnets somewhere (maybe not on the playfield, but at least in the cabinet - they didn't care about game features or not, just the total count).We could know for sure [that this is a Test Game] if we could see the manufacture date on the back of the backbox or cabinet, there is usually a dated sticker. Though sometimes those test games would come back, sit for a while, and then get a sticker with a date later than the production run! That would also be a dead giveaway.If Orin's second recollection is correct, then there may be games that had exported to Japan with uninstalled magnets packed inside the cabinet even if there was no easy way to subsequently wire them to the finished playfield or to activate any nascent software coding for them, if the coding was not already excised before exportation. We assume the playfield underside would have had the large round cut-outs for these magnets, like the example shown in this listing of a blank playfield that has them. Research would be needed to investigate these assumptions. Separate from the Test Game, Orin also commented on the prototype translite and prototype cabinet, shown in this listing courtesy of the PinGame Journal:These are pictures of a true prototype cabinet and backglass artwork. That first whitewood game was a narrow-body pinball but all the wrestlers were steroid-inflated widebodies. Some steroid scandal hit and WWF made DE redo the artwork so the wrestlers were more sleek, while in the meantime we decided the market needed more widebody pinballs. There was line art done for the narrow body playfield but there was never a screened playfield, just a whitewood, and I don't think it was ever actually built up and playable.We previously listed the Manufacture Date as May, 1994.This game was produced from Apr-11-1994 to Jun-17-1994.",

You can learn more about Ciani's involvement in Xenon at her official website, which has a lot of information about this game.Pinball art collector Harold Balde reports this information to accompany his image of an experimental playfield overlay:Bally experimented with printing the artwork on mylar then attaching it to the playfield as a cost savings measure.  The artwork is not the same as the production Xenon - Paul Faris went back and airbrushed the art to make it look better for the 4-color process.  At least one or two games were made with this overlay.Artist Paul Faris told us that he recalls there was a problem of applying those mylar overlays accurately after the boards had been routed and the inserts glued in."

The historic dash inspired two films and the train's nickname, \"Silver Streak\".

Jeanine Mitchell did the color art.Pictured in this listing is a prototype whitewood that was never made, having a small mini-playfield recessed below the main playfield. The following information was provided to us by the owner to accompany the pictures:� Various parts from Rescue 911 and Street Fighter II appear in this prototype, in addition to various parts that don't appear to be present in any other games, such as the right wire form ramp and the middle vacuum-formed ramp.� The lower playfield only has a ball kicker to launch a ball held captive on the lower playfield. No flipper is present.� The playfield inserts have hand-written labels similar to those found on the production version of Stargate.� The game does not have ROMs. I installed standard Stargate ROMs temporarily to try to get the boards to boot.The cabinet body is blank, and is painted blue. The head is from a Street Fighter II. The front of the cabinet has a handwritten note \"Special spottings for legs\" with arrows pointing to the bolt holes for the legs.� The transformer panel does not have fuse labels. There is a sticker on the panel which reads \"Bottom Panel Tester #2\".� The aux sound card is unfinished, and it is unable to be connected to the main sound card in its current state.� There is an oddity with the shooter lane in that the cabinet hole is not correct for a launch button like on mario brothers, but the auto-shooter is in the way so the playfield can't accommodate a standard shooter rod.� The rear edge of the playfield has some notes written on it, which reads \"1st #742 whitewood   never made   #5 & 6 Plates  10-21-94  (RT)\". I'm assuming that is supposed to be Ray Tanzer's initials at the end.",

A moving \"Glidercraft\" ship will be extended from the pyramid when the pyramid is open.

These are basically the reverse of drop targets: they are targets that rather of dropping down into the playfield when hit, instead rise up into the air!  Each target is attached to a large \"Horus\" structure, which is itself attached to a pivot that the game can raise and lower.  These Horus drop down to block the player from reaching two key shots.  The game occasionally raises them, allowing the player to temporarily make the shots.",

Decals were added to cover up the post holes, and a third decal was added near the rollover button. The decals may have been added after-factory.The owner of the game pictured here notes that the hole for the rollover button is roughly cut out, suggesting it was not done at the factory. The triangular metal bumper has grooves at its corners to allow a rubber to fit around it for better contact with the ball in play. The game was not operational so we do not know which direction this bumper rotates, or how fast, but the motor appears to be able to provide a decent spin instead of a slow rotation. The motor has a stamp from the Alliance Manufacturing Company, a company of which we have no further information."

		"notes": "Voices of Greg Freres and Steve Ritchie are \"Wise Guy\" and \"Skull\"; Greg and Steve wrote the speech script together.Pictured in this listing is a game, serial number 100824, with its skull toy having a curious yellow discoloration everywhere except the jawbone. The game came with an operators manual printed in German and its cabinet had been fitted with a ticker vender mechanism. Such mechanisms are banned in Germany, so the owner assumes the vender was added in Italy, where he obtained the game.  He brought the game back to Germany and subsequently he met up with artist Greg Freres at a show there. Later, we asked Greg to comment on the discoloration of the skull. He replied:I really don't know why the top part of the skull was discolored compared to the \"jaw\" portion. My assumption was that we may have tried to do a \"wipe\" technique on early parts (painting the part to create some visual interest and then wiping it off leaving a bit of a patina behind. This technique was usually reserved for parts that had texture built into the part. For instance, the skull entrance on EATPM used this wipe process to enhance the texture, or the climbing rock on No Fear also used this technique to give the rocks a more natural look. However, this No Fear skull was a smooth part to begin with so a wipe technique doesn't make much sense because there aren't any \"nooks & crannies\" for the paint to get left behind. BUT this skull has some slight texture in it...this lead me to believe that MAYBE this was an early part pulled off a temporary tool and that temp tool may not have been sanded to a smooth finish...MAYBE we were still experimenting with the idea of having the iconic NF skull symbol pushed more towards a real skull instead of a 3D representation of their logo (???) I also thought that MAYBE this skull was discolored from years inside a smoky bistro BUT why then wasn't the \"jaw\" section as discolored? That's why I started thinking we may have been experimenting and this one got left on a proto game. Secondly, once it was brought to my attention that the game had a low serial number I noticed the translite was also an early translite, not the finished production translite. You probably already know the story about the ski outfit that Glenn Plake is wearing - production has a red and black combo vs the all yellow outfit that I painted on the illustration. I think about 200 translites were printed to cover the \"sample\" run, and then we fixed the art, re-ran the films, and printed the rest of the production translites with the new colors. So the fact that his game ALSO has the early translite leads me to believe that his game is possibly from the proto run - perhaps one of the first batch of games that ended up in Germany (or Europe).Greg also pointed out to us that Williams certainly would not have added a ticket vender to the side of the cabinet. He is cautious to actually pronounce the skull�s yellow color as an authentic factory result, and we allow the possibility that the Italian distributor or operator (or whoever added the ticket vender) may have experimented with it. We also note that the serial number, while relatively low, is not within the first 200 made. Still, there is the Sample translite, and for the story interest alone do we show pictures of this game with its translite, skull, and ticket vender.",

The right side of these cabinets, for instance, did not show a gradation from orange to yellow behind the race cars but had instead a solid red color there, and the black color in the area of the backbox hinge had a solid yellow border color. Upon closer comparison to the more common cabinet, the race car tires appeared to be a darker blue, and even the playfield's blue color seemed to be darker, if not royal purple.Mark Weyna explained much about what we saw:There was a BUNCH of color changing going on with the playfield and cabinet very late in the development. The backglass pretty much stayed the same. The changes were based on our German distributor commenting on the color scheme and relating it to \"baby colors\" which started a wave of color changing. I have a cabinet test panel on Masonite that is the full red with more purplish tires. My own Indy 500 game was the photoshoot machine for the brochure, which was a VERY early sample run game, and it has the orange to yellow treatment.  Also, to add to the confusion, the Indy's seem to have faded more than other cabinets of the era... There where also at least two playfield color versions - I have a rich red to purple NOS playfield and my game (photoshoot, remember) is more orange to lighter blue towards the bottom. I think the protos were done one way, the sample run done another way (like my game), and the production games were a third version.",

During single-player games, the switches are made active only on the opponent's flippers, and a ball striking those flippers causes them to energize and \"Auto-flip\" the ball back towards the player.",

The pictures of the insides of the backbox show it has no provision for replays. Curiously, the backglass on this game has a replay window which obviously serves no purpose.  In addition, this glass is missing both the manufacturer name and the date portion of the name (the '1957'). It is not likely that Williams would omit their brand name from any glass that left their factory. We are aware of one instance of an arcade operator (in Myrtle Beach) having purchased a row of these games (novelty and/or replay) for their location and having had special backglasses made for them, to omit the manufacturer name and, we suspect, omit the date as well so as to not make their investment age too quickly. Presumably, arcade operators in other locales could have done the same. The manufacturer's branded and dated backglass can be seen in the book Pinball An Illustrated History.Based on the above information, we can say that the game pictured here is the novelty play Model 183 but with one of these after-factory arcade backglasses from having once been in an arcade.The replay version of this game is Williams '1957 Baseball Deluxe'.This listing was previously titled \"Deluxe Baseball 1957 New York\"."

Its success transformed Harry Williams into a major player in the industry.In an interview with pinball historian Russ Jensen on April 7, 1982, Harry Williams estimated that the production of all four cabinet models totaled between 28 and 33 thousand units. He said the first models had neither a tilt mechanism nor bells, but that both were added somewhere during the first 100 games produced. He then said that later models used an electric \"pull-chain\" tilt mechanism he designed, having an indicator on the playfield which pointed to either \"OK\" or \"TILT\".",

If this Daily Dozen backglass with inclined rows is genuine, the incline implies that the backbox insert would also have inclined rows of light bulbs, unlike what we would expect for Reserve. We don't know what other differences there may be between the two models.A second game shown here has a backglass with level rows and thus appears to be a 'Reserve' backglass that was altered, perhaps by an operator, to indicate the name 'Daily Dozen'. Its center area clearly has been altered since it left the factory. We were unable to learn from the owner if the rows of bulbs in the backbox insert were inclined or level, to assist in any determination if this particular cabinet body properly belongs to the Reserve model and not the Daily Dozen model, assuming there are concrete differences in cabinet art and internal mechanisms between the two models."

It was short and said I was the only one listed as owning a Dracula on a certain website [at the time].\"I have my suspicion that someone at Williams sent them to me. I always thought they were prototypes because they were unpainted, unlike the production models, and were molded from glow in the dark plastic. It makes me wonder if they were considering a blacklight for lighting. Feel free to post the pictures and the story. Maybe the person who sent them to me will see it and tell us more.\"Also pictured in this listing is a game with prototype stacked slingshot plastics showing Keanu Reeves & Winona Ryder's characters on them. According to designer Barry Oursler, these plastics were removed prior to production because the actors [or perhaps only Winona Ryder] would not sign a release to use their images. However, we have been told Williams did not remove these plastics from the butyrate sheets that held the full set of playfield plastics if someone was to buy the plastics separately. Thus, while these 'prototype' plastics may not have left the factory on any game, it would have been easy to obtain them and retro-fit them onto a game.An earlier game that used a magnet to move the ball across the mid-playfield is Sega Enterprises' 1973 'Galaxy'.",

Both have eleven girls on the backglass to light up by hitting numbered pop bumpers or by falling in the kick-out hole, with #10 and #11 lit only by falling in the kick-out hole, which then ejects ball towards the outhole.This is one of the games clearly seen being smashed in the 1975 Hollywood movie 'Tommy' upon which Bally's 1975 'Wizard!' was based. An image from the movie is included in this listing.In the book The Pinball Compendium Electro-mechanical Era, Ed Krynski is quoted as saying this was the first pinball game he designed."

		"notes": "The year of manufacture was previously listed as 1977 but both the backglass and the playfield show the artist Michele Martinelli signed it as \"Mike 79\".The backglass also has a signature \"Kobra B\". Italian collector Federico Croci asked Martinelli about it. He replied that he had guys sometimes helping him to complete the work when they were in a hurry, but he can't remember their exact names.  They were guys working at the printing facility where the backglasses and playfields were made. We have seen this name shown as \"B Kobra\" on at least one other game.The manufacturer's flyer shown here is printed with a yellow tinge that colors the white paint and wood grain and metal. The game it shows has a different style and placement of manufacturer logo on its backglass, playfield and apron than the games we have seen, and we note the trivial absence of outlane mini-posts. One important trait of this game, however, is the two 4-banks of drop targets in the upper playfield.Images 37382 to 37388 show a game with the same drop target placement as the flyer game and mini-posts have been added to the outlanes. The backbox insert shows on its front side two boards mounted side by side, connected to each other with a white ribbon cable. We presume that this machine has chimes in the lower cabinet but this has not been confirmed.Images 64419 to 64437 show a game having extensive modifications to its playfield. The two 4-banks of drop targets were replaced with four star rollovers and a spinning target. One 4-bank of drop targets was installed in place of a right-side standup target, and a single drop target was added to the upper left lane. We cannot see if mini-posts exist. On the backbox insert, there is one long board instead of two ribbon-connected boards and a small sound card was mounted nearby. The front inside wall of the cabinet has three screw holes for the chime unit. The holes look enlarged from use so likely a chime unit existed but was removed. We assume the sound card completely replaced the need for chimes. A speaker is mounted directly over one of the two vents, the left one, at the rear of the lower cabinet.Images 64439 to 64450 show another game with the same extensive playfield modifications. Outlane mini-posts are present. Its backbox insert also has one long board and the smaller sound card. However, this game still has its chime unit installed although we do not know if it is operative. A speaker is mounted directly over one of the two vents, the right one, at the rear of the lower cabinet.Because of these few examples of this heavily modified playfield and its different insert boards, we presume there may be more examples like this in existence. Although we have yet found manufacturer documentation or other information for this modified playfield, the degree of its reengineering seems to be the serious domain of either a manufacturer or a large and talented distributor, not an operator. We note there was no attempt to adjust the artwork on these playfields to make aesthetic sense with the modifications.The manufacturer's manual in this listing is not much help to clarify what we see. It shows a picture on its cover of the same game as in the flyer, with the two 4-bank drop targets in the upper playfield.  Yet, it also shows the backbox version having one long card but no smaller sound card, a board combination that we have thus far only associated with the modified playfield. The text does not mention anything concerning the sounds for this game, whether electronic or chimes.We invite additional information and documentation for this game, whether original or variation."

By this time, more cabinets (and backboxes) had already been made than what would be required for the final production run quantity. The backbox for this game was unique and required a short backglass. The excess backboxes would later be used for the production runs of Defender, Time Fantasy, and Firepower II.Manufacturer data for Hyperball:BOM cost per game: naProduction Start Date: Dec-30-1981Production End Date: May-28-1982Total quantity produced: 5,000Quantity sold: 4,444Price to Distributor: $2150.00This 1981 arcade game has an alpha-numeric display in the lower playfield.

We have no pictures of Playmatic's 1987 'Skill Flight' to compare further.In this listing are two pictures of a version of Skill Flight with a Bally coin door and a grayish color of cabinet instead of black. It has the Bell Games logo on the lower apron but not on the backglass. There is no separate speaker grill panel. Instead of the speaker grille with the analog wave design, the lower end of the backglass shows a horizontal black sign containing the large words PINBALL ADVENTURE in purple letters. The 3rd and 4th player score windows have been placed further down the glass, well below the pilot's shoulders. The 7-digit score windows each used Bally 6-digit displays followed by a \"dummy\" digital zero in the units column.We invite your pictures and additional information for either version mentioned above.We have seen pictures (not shown here) of cabinet side panel veneers having the same art as this game.

Also, the cabinet has the name incorrectly spelled as \"Simbad\". We asked Federico Croci, a collector in Italy, to comment on this. He replies:\"I've never seen 'Sinbad' equipped with those black score reels except for the one featured in the magazine ad. Actually, those Gottlieb black score reels were not popular and were always removed, even on the original Gottlieb games that were produced with them installed.\"Also, the 'Simbad' doesn't exist. It was a misspelling on the cabinet of the sample game used for the photo of the ad. If you look closely at the ad, you can read the name on the backglass, which was 'Sinbad'. They also misspelled the name in the text of the ad, but that's not an official ad, just a page from a local reseller of the game, which I suppose reprinted the sample photo received from the manufacturer, the one with the misspelled name, and so they printed it wrong in the ad.\"Sinbad (Sindbad) the Sailor was a character in one of the folk tales of classic Arabic literature known collectively as The Thousand and One Nights (aka The Arabian Nights)."

(Three other rollover switches are elsewhere on the playfield, making a total of seven rollovers.) All seven holes have wire-form kickers tied to a single solenoid. Balls landing in any of these seven holes do not automatically kick-out but stay put until another ball closes any of the seven rollover switches. Closing any rollover switch causes the solenoid to kick-out all seven holes simultaneously. In this way, multiball is achieved and allows these balls a new chance to reach the higher-scoring holes in the lower playfield. Each of two kickers at bottom of playfield has its switch mounted directly on the face of its kicking plate. Each has its own solenoid, thus can independently and immediately kick any ball that closes its switch.",

M. Laboratories' 1936 'Soccer' which was made for the domestic market."

		"notes": "Williams Parts Catalog Supplement #16-9190-B states \"All parts & assemblies for Slugfest 2 (60021) are identical to Slugfest (60001) except for the Card Dispenser Assembly.\" However, additional differences have been identified and are itemized elsewhere in this listing.During production of Model 60001, the screen assembly at rear of playfield was modified, beginning with game serial number 730516.Bill \"Pfutz\" Pfutzenreuter told us he programmed this game almost entirely on a blank switch and lamp matrix. With the game almost done except for the sound effects, he left for vacation, leaving instructions for what sounds should be put on what hex codes. The sound guy [not confirmed as Paul Heitsch] just filled them in and the game automatically used them. Pfutz had only a few bugs to fix upon his return.This game was sold with either a baseball card dispenser or a standard ticket dispenser (per Mark Ritchie in The Pinball Compendium 1982-Present, page 142.)Mark Ritchie told us that with the original card dispenser, cards would come out the front of the unit and drop to the floor. To prevent that, it was decided after the prototypes were built to add a hopper or \"card catcher\" under the cabinet, and the cards would be dispensed from under the cabinet into that hopper. This listing has pictures of a game with this \"front dispenser\" so we don't know when in the production run this change occurred.A VHS videotape (length 09:30) was supplied by Williams, reportedly for required viewing by pinball distributors, introducing the designer and the game.See also:Model 60021 aka \"SLUGFEST 2\" - Williams' 1991 'SlugFest (Second Model)'Model 60121 aka \"SLUGFEST92\" - Williams' 'SlugFest (Third Model)'"

When news of the mission broke, President Franklin Roosevelt was asked by reporters to identify the base from which our fighting planes originated. Not wanting to make that detail public, he replied, 'They came from our new secret base at Shangri-La.'Shangri-La was actually a mythical place in James Hilton's 1933 novel Lost Horizon, which became a movie in 1937 and again in 1973. Hilton also wrote Good-bye, Mr Chips, a probable basis for the name of the Genco game used to make this pinball conversion."

This is because Genco used two different backboxes for their Trade Winds game with one being taller than the other, requiring a modified Trade Winds backglass (taller). The game cabinet pictured here is the taller version and originally had the taller Trade Winds backglass in it. That glass was in poor shape so the owner replaced it with the regular-sized Mandalay glass, essentially performing a partial kit conversion.Because the two Trade Winds cabinets have very different artwork, we can expect to see examples of Mandalay games with either of the two cabinet artworks."

		"notes": "'Marines At Play' was a conversion of Bally's 1941 'Flicker'.This is the advertised second run of Westerhaus Amusement Co.'s 1944 'Marines At Play (1st Edition)'. Westerhaus called this edition their \"1945 model\". Their ad specified \"many added features\" for this second run, such as \"2 new 5000 bumpers, the 5000 roll-over and the 2-5 free play bumpers\". However, the game pictured in the July 1945 ad that announces this edition (shown here) is identical to the picture used in their 1944 ads, and the playfield cannot be clearly seen in these pictures. Perhaps they did not yet have an updated picture when they placed this announcement. In any case, we are not sure if this second run truly had new features unique to it, or if it is simply a continuation of the design change that occurred during the first run.This is the last game produced by Westerhaus Manufacturing Company which only a few months earlier had come into being when it split off from Westerhaus Amusement Company, moving production to 3418 Harrison Ave and leaving the Amusement Company at 3726 Kessen Avenue to function as an operator. The Manufacturing Company did not last long, because a Billboard announcement dated Sep-8-1945 p102 (shown here) indicates their equipment and building at 3418 Harrison was taken over by Esquire Manufacturing Company, retaining Bill Hardig as sales manager and indicating that this new company would continue to offer Westerhaus conversions to the trade. Perhaps Esquire meant only to deplete their acquired inventory of Westerhaus games, as we cannot find any further online mention of Esquire except a 1955 Billboard ad where they supplied toy gun and holster sets as prizes for a children's contest sponsored by Pepsi. Westerhaus Amusement became Pioneer Vending, still at 3726 Kessen, and today is owned by Bill Westerhaus, grandson of the founder."

The ad pictures a game looking perfectly identical to Gottlieb's 1931 'Stop and Sock'.

		"features": "Spring bumpers (13). Mechanical backbox animation (spaceships fly in and out of view). Two backglasses, spaced 3.1 cm apart, each have artwork on them, and the player can look through both of them to see a distant city and mountains on the inside of the backbox door. This provides a 3-D effect to the player.The player places a coin in the coin slide and pushes it in, which starts the game, sets the game timer (approximately 4 minutes), and starts the rotating spaceship motor in the backbox. This motor turns at a constant rate of speed and a full revolution takes 12 seconds, always making one of two moving spaceships viewable by the player for approximately 6 seconds, having a short gap of time when no spaceship is in view. A light bulb illuminates the backbox scene whenever a spaceship is in view. The only light bulbs on the playfield are inside two of the thirteen bumpers, both having red caps, and both labeled \"Repeater\". When a spaceship comes into view, the two red Repeater bumpers illuminate simultaneously and if a ball in play hits either of them when lit, the rotating spaceship mechanism awards 100 points repeatedly until the spaceship disappears from view. Therefore, hitting a lit Repeater just as it lights up would catch the spaceship at the beginning of its viewable arc of travel and would maximize the number of 100-point awards before the spaceship disappears from view (and the red bumpers turn off). The maximum points possible for timely hitting a lit Repeater bumper is 700 but only because the operator can option each spaceship to award from 100 to 700 points in 100-point increments. The operator does this by installing one to seven screws on the outer ring of two rings of holes in the rotating disk of the backbox motor, for each spaceship. If desired, one spaceship can be made liberal and one can be conservative. Each screw head generates a pulse to the score stepping unit as the disk rotates, but only when the \"repeater relay\" is activated by hitting a lit Repeater bumper.In the small gap of time after a spaceship leaves the view and before the other one comes into view, the entire playfield is disabled and cannot score points, the red bumper lights are turned off, and the repeater relay is deactivated. The operator can increase the amount of dead playfield time by setting a portion of a spaceship�s 6-second travel time to disable the playfield. The operator does this by installing either one, two, or three screws on the inner ring of the two rings of holes in the rotating disk of the backbox motor, for each spaceship. If desired, the two gaps can be of different lengths of time by setting one spaceship to be liberal and one to be conservative.The three options per spaceship provide these approximate time intervals:1 screw = 1.5 seconds of playfield disable time and 4.5 seconds enable time = 6.0 seconds.2 screws = 1.0 second of playfield disable time and 5.0 seconds enable time = 6.0 seconds.3 screws = 0.5 second of playfield disable time and 5.5 seconds enable time = 6.0 seconds.This game has ten high score levels for the player to beat. The first high score is an operator choice of only one of these five score levels: 2800, 2900, 3000, 3100, or 3200. After that, nine hardwired score levels are always active: 3600, 3900, 4200, 4500, 4600, 4700, 4800, 4900 and 5000. Maximum score stops at 5200 points. As no replays are given by the machine, these score levels are \"active\" in that they are wired to a counter inside the game that increments each time a score level is reached. It does not count the number of games played. If the location chose to pay out cash to patrons who reach any of these high score levels, the backglass score had to be witnessed before the timer shut the game off. The operator would later reimburse the location based on the counter's new total since the last visit.The rotating disk does not stop when the game is tilted. It stops only when the main voltage is turned off once the game timer runs out.",
		"notes": "The backbox door on the game pictured here is not original and does not have the mountainous scene as shown in the Billboard ad. A previous owner fitted a plywood replacement painted blue and stapled little rockets onto it. The game was also missing the light source for the backbox illumination, leaving a small plug in the backbox without its mate, suggesting that this light may have been attached to the original back door."

Their last Billboard ad for this kit was 10/05/1946 p123, when prices were raised for all of their kits from $9.50 each to $12.50 each.See also Victory Games' 'Miss America '45'.We assume for 1946 that the date on the backglass was updated again but we have not found specific evidence of this."

Getting the Special illuminates the words 'Bonus Ball' on the backglass and awards an extra ball. Maximum one Bonus Ball per ball played, and an unearned lit Special does not carry-over to the next ball. A liberal/conservative operator option allows the arrows to advance two steps per switch hit instead of just one step. The 'arrow advance' units under the playfield are actually the clever repurposing of score reel units, and a numberless score reel is attached to each one. Reportedly, the clicking sound each reel makes is not noticeable during game play.Maximum displayed point score is 9,999,000 points.Replay wheel maximum: 37Sound: electronic card and speaker with volume pot, knocker.",
		"notes": "The artist's initials can be seen on the backglass, on the tail of the aircraft on the tarmac.Pictured in this listing is an Early Production game with serial number 0003 and having bumper caps with the 'radial blue arrows' design indicating '1000 points\", just like the game in the manufacturer flyer. At variance from the flyer, the factory did not wire a jack in this game to allow a choice between Replay or Add-a-ball modes, leaving it as Replay-only, a fact supported by the schematic that came with the game. That is probably why only the first five of the ten Ball-in-Play lights in the backbox insert were wired with lamp sockets, leaving blank holes for what would be balls 6 thru 10. Elsewhere on the insert, the factory labeled a place for a jack field for the operator to select one of ten score thresholds at which the biri-biri sound would play, but did not install the jack for it. We speculate that the higher thresholds for this award would require an add-a-ball mode that this game did not have. The schematic indicated biri-biri was awarded at a fixed threshold of 4 million points.Our speculation may be groundless because we have pictures of a game with serial number 0120 showing it also does not have the biri-biri threshold jack, yet it does have the factory-installed Add-a-ball capability. A former owner of this game states the biri-biri activated at a fixed threshold of 4 million points (with a sound effect as if World War III has begun!) but there was no schematic with the game to see if it supported Add-a-ball without biri-biri threshold choices. Nine of the ten Ball-in-Play lights in the backbox insert were wired with lamp sockets, leaving a blank hole for the tenth one. A design error exists that allows a player to insert a second coin just before shooting the first ball in play, and this adds additional balls to play. Interestingly, this game has an alternate backglass design, in that the wings of the airborne Concorde lack the many gold and blue lines shown on all other glasses for which we have pictures. Also, the control tower is drawn without the artful lines to indicate it was constructed of individual bricks. Our only image of this backglass barely evidences these unique differences, and we invite additional images from anyone who might have this 'alternate' version. As would be expected of a replay export game, the reverse side of the backglass shows the ball count for 6 through 10 is represented by actual numbers and not the typical symbols used by games intended for domestic use in Italy.**The first Concorde, the 001, flew its maiden flight on March 2, 1969 over France. The first commercial passenger flights took place on January 21, 1976 when a British Airways flight traveled from Heathrow to Bahrain at the same time that an Air France jet flew from Paris to Rio de Janeiro. The last supersonic flight occurred October 24, 2003 when British Airways flew from New York to Heathrow. Air France had already grounded its supersonic fleet the previous May.The British/French Concorde was not the first supersonic airliner to fly. A Soviet prototype Tupolev TU-144 made its first flight on December 31, 1968 but didn't break the sound barrier until June 5, 1969."

One version has two airplanes in the sky, while the other has none. Until we have more and definitive information, we will assume the two backglasses define the different model numbers and we thus separate the images to each listing, not knowing which version of backglass is which model number.The game pictured here has no airplanes in the sky and, unlike the game shown in the other listing, we do not know if it has a replay stepper or relay under the coin chute to allow the chute to be operated without a coin.We also feature in this listing a playfield that was used as a wall hanging, thus its reverse side is stripped of parts, leaving only some wire and a card showing the operator-selected payout scores. This playfield therefore cannot be the novelty version of 'Miami' and so we show it here instead of in the other listing that is designated 'Novelty Play'.We previously showed a Production Run quantity of 976 units which had erroneously included the 461 units for the other Miami game."

		"notes": "Conversion of Bally's 1980 'Silverball Mania'. Lower left backglass has M-A-G-I-C lights. Reinhard Deutsch, owner of Arkon and the inventor of the Picture Pin�, produced this game after AMOA personnel made him cover the backglass of his Sexy Girl game at one of their shows. He noticed that it only drew more attention from customers. He then decided to make Magic Picture Pin so that operators could simply change the backglass and film cassette and again have that risque earlier game.Both the flyer and apron indicate Arkon Automaten. No other company name is evident."

The timer is visible to the player and if the game runs out of time, a ticket is awarded.The software for the game is noticeably incomplete. Issues include:- Asking the player to 'Continue?

A timer stops the spinning bumper and ends the game.An article in Billboard dated Feb-8-1964 page 49 indicates that the Federal Government, in response to a legal challenge, reclassified 'Spinner' from a gaming device to an amusement device.

However, we cannot find evidence that Bally ever produced that game. Danny Leach, a bingo machine historian, notes that 'New Orleans' is the only SIRMO game that does not state 'SIRMO' on the game manual. Bally's last known bingo game is Bally's 1980 'Continental' of which the entire production run was shipped to Belgium. It's very likely that what began in Bally as 'Mississippi Showboat' ended up being produced as Sirmo's 'New Orleans'.If anyone has either game, 'Mississippi Showboat' or 'New Orleans', please contact us."

The production games we have seen all have winged outer flippers that are blue in color while the inner flippers are red and wingless.Early sample machines reportedly included a backglass animation not found on production machines.

		"notes": "The backglass shows the spaceship from the 1960's TV show 'Star Trek', also depicted on Bally's 1979 'Star Trek'.The playfield is identical in design to Bally's 1979 'Supersonic'.The game pictured here was found for sale on a gas station bulletin board near Dekalb, Illinois in 2008. The seller had purchased it from a retired executive.We asked designer Greg Kmiec how many units of this game were actually made. He replies:As I remember, only 1 engineering sample playfield and cabinet of Star Ship were made.  Two backglasses were made, one for the game and one for art registration.We subsequently received a picture of a second, NOS playfield, for this listing.Greg Kmiec also explains why this game never went into production but instead was later used to make Supersonic:I had just designed Wizard and Capt. Fantastic. I quickly went on to design a whitewood game called \"Super Shooter\" with two S's as bonus lights. That game was renamed \"Star Ship\" probably because of the bonus lights, and a futuristic art theme was added. Bally had just realized it was a bonus to manufacture licensed games like Wizard and Capt. Fantastic. (It distinguished Bally from the rest of the pack.) Bally went out and procured the Star Trek license.  I had just done two licensed games. Bally management hired a new designer and gave him the Star Trek license in order to spread licensed games among the four designers.  After Star Ship was done, I was already working on Night Rider EM, a game that was themed after the then popular CB radio fad. It was imperative to get a CB-themed game in the market ASAP. Night Rider was deemed too good of a game to change its name. (Changing \"Night Rider\" to \"Star Trek\" would have delayed a CB-themed game by about a year. In retrospect, the drop target banks probably could have spelled S-T-A-R T-R-E-K. But it all worked out, as Night Rider SS became the test game for Bally solid state games.)So there was \"Star Ship\", a complete game all designed with artwork, with the two S's as bonus lights, [while the Star Trek license had been assigned to another designer]. What was Bally to do?  \"Star Ship\" was designed as an economy game in a \"push\" market. What that meant was that because of the success of Wizard and Capt. Fantastic, Bally was able to \"push\" game orders to distributors instead of distributors \"pulling\" game orders from Bally. And the bonus to Bally was that these \"push\" games were inexpensive to make but sold just as many as other games.  Bally didn't want to kill the \"Star Ship\" game. Therefore, a new theme, \"Supersonic\", was created, to take into account the two bonus light S's. (And, \"Supersonic\" is a spacey sounding theme.) In a game designed from scratch, the \"T\" of \"SST\" would have had bonus lights in it.To my knowledge, Supersonic is the only Bally game that had two production names, \"Star Ship\" and \"Supersonic.\""

Dan Langlois brought in a playfield that I *think* was going to be a car race theme(?). At some point he abandoned the project but the playfield was still a somewhat valid layout. Pat McMahon and I had talked about pitching the idea for Diesel Demon and Pat ended up doing some amazing sketches with a zombie-like trucker in a huge rig, with the pipes turning into demon-like characters all their own. In front of the rig was a volkswagen beetle driven by two unsuspecting females putting their make-up on whilst driving. It was awesome, but our management thought it too edgy for the truck stop locations or family arcades...plus the whole \"demon\" connotation was a bit much.Our then-President, Joe Dillon, decided to bring in an outside designer, Steve Kirk, to add his input to the project. Under his direction, it became Ramp Warrior, a slightly more politically-correct version of Diesel Demon, and the rest was supposed to be history...until we made the shift from Bally/Midway to Williams. The project got re-looked at from a committee of people trying to squeak out the first Bally game from the Williams factory. After the committee finished up, it was called Truck Stop and the rest was then history."

What resulted was a game of such wild popularity in the United States that it caught the coin-op world by surprise and caused innumerable imitations by other companies, leading into the pinball patent wars.Whiffle is the game most often associated with the birth of pinball, but according to the Encyclopedia of Pinball Vol 1, the first true pinball was Charles P. Young's \"Coin Game Board\" trade stimulator of 1892, which was also glass-covered and coin-operated. The idea to add coin mechanisms to machines came even earlier, from British inventor Percival Everett, but it was Londoner Henry John Gerrard Pessers who was first to put a coin slot on a marble game, patented September 29, 1889.For Automatic Industries' predecessor to this game, see Yohio Mfg.'s 1931 'Old Jenny (Whiffle)'.",

Pacent could not have subsequently manufactured 'Right Or Else' to be advertised the following September as \"new\". Also, it was not advertised among the games they displayed at the January 1937 Coin Machine Exposition in Chicago.The sponsor of the September Billboard ad, Capitol Automatic Amusement Company, was \"the country�s largest music operating organization\" and sold musical instruments. The only items we found that they manufactured were coin-operated phonographs. In the ad, they identified themselves as 'Factory Agents'.We know that Pacent was formed in May 1936 but did not have their own manufacturing facility until September 1936 when they leased a building in Utica for this purpose. In the interim, according to the Encyclopedia of Pinball Vol 2, initial production of 'Bolo' was jobbed out \"all around Utica, with half a dozen suppliers making components and assembling games.\"Any one of these anonymous locations that made 'Bolo' between May and September 1936 could have been the 1937 manufacturing location for 'Right Or Else' to which Capitol referred. Or, perhaps Pacent employees remained at their new building, post-bankruptcy, making new games under a new company name that is unknown to us.Until we find better information for this game than our one Billboard ad, we do not know who manufactured it."

The design and the new rules were his own work, and the art was approved by him as well. The games to be converted were shipped from France to Italy, and the games were assembled and decorated entirely in Italy by someone named Castagno in Milan for the technical part and by Baldazzi [The Pinball Shop] in Bologna for the art. All that was used from the original game was the prom, part of the wiring, electronic cards, and whatever parts that could be reused. All the rest of the necessary parts were available in Italy. The completed games were then shipped back to France.Tabart probably meant only the playfield layout was based on 'Sinbad' because the backglass and upper playfield artwork clearly show actress Brooke Shields who starred in the 1983 Hollywood movie \"Sahara\".Shown in this listing are two stickers which Tabart affixed to the aprons of the machines he operated in bars to identify himself as the owner and to advertise his company."

Place balls one at a time in alley and use cue to shoot. After shooting ten balls, count the total in the score slots at lower end of case.

This brief June article mentions \"Five Plants\" but unfortunately does not explain anything more about that. Also included here are two pictures from the same June 1967 Billboard showing production lines.

The image is on a post card, and a strict reading of the text on this card does not actually identify the name of the company who performed the modification. We found an online copy of the Reno Evening Gazette dated Friday, June 11, 1971 where on page 26 a notice stated that a business license had been recently approved for Nevada Novelty, Inc. at 44 W. Liberty St. which is the address on the post card. Without a dated postal cancellation on the card to guide us, we cannot say if the card came from that company or from a previous tenant. The address no longer exists. The Eastland Bill of 1962 brought severe consequences to Bally Manufacturing Company in terms of limiting the market for bingo machines (see Bally's 1963 'Bounty'), games which were deemed gambling devices even though they contained no cash payout mechanisms. In light of that congressional censure on gambling, we wondered of the connection between the manufacturing company and the company that distributed these modified cash payout bingos in Nevada, that they would share the name 'Bally'. According to the book King of the Slots, prior to 1975 Bally Manufacturing Company CEO Bill O'Donnell had a personal 30% stake in Bally Distributing Company. (For how long prior to 1975, we don't know. He was company president since 1963.) In 1975, the 69.5% controlling interest owned by William \"Si\" Redd and the trust of Ivy Lee Redd was transferred to Bally Manufacturing Company."

		"notes": "'Jack-Bot' is third in a series of games with a robot theme, including Williams' 1986 'PIN�BOT' and Williams' 1991 'The Machine: Bride of Pin�bot'.Some games in the production run were built using WPC-95 board sets.Two different playfield versions for this game are noticed, where just below the 5-bank of targets one version uses five arrow inserts that are all white in color, and the other version uses five arrow inserts of different colors.There also are two different plastics used above the entrance to the left ramp where it states \"Lite Game Saucer Mega Ramp\". One version is a simple light blue with pattern while the other is a fancier black and purple design.It is unknown to us which version of playfield and/or ramp plastic came first, or the reasons for them. Consider these variations: The flyer has colored arrows and the light blue ramp plastic. The promo poster has all white arrows and the light blue ramp plastic. One game pictured in this listing has white arrows and the blue & purple ramp plastic, while another game pictured here has the colored arrows and the light blue ramp plastic.In The Pinball Compendium 1982 to Present, Larry DeMar is quoted to say they had briefly considered naming this game \"Lucky Star\".Included in this listing are pictures of a cabinet from the game with serial number 53351102134. Instead of the color red, a different color is shown, described by the owner as orange-yellow. Because this color appears on all sides, it is difficult to attribute it to \"red fade\" from the sun. If anyone has a similar cabinet, please contact us and include your serial number.",

Perhaps they updated the technology, such as the MPU. We also don't know if the 'Romset Version 2' in our Files section is labeled that way to indicate it belongs to only one production version but not the other. We have only one manufacturer date of 1979 and don't know if this date applies to both versions. Until we have more information, both versions are presented together in this listing. We are seeking a high-resolution close-up image of this game to show the long drop-target bank chassis, its probable two reset coils, and with all of its targets in the dropped position.

She and Dagwood fell in love and married on February 17, 1933 which by then Dagwood was disinherited from his father's wealth for choosing someone of a lower social status. In his new economic condition, Dagwood rented a house for themselves, rode the bus to work, and together they lived a humble lifestyle of love without money which was very appealing to Americans at this time of the Great Depression.

For example, the game shown in this listing stamped with serial number 'B869' also has the date '10-31-63' stamped on it.Bally's game listing also shows 'Bounty' as project #727 being a novelty game.Pictured in this listing is an operator-modified backglass. In the lower left corner, the factory's silkscreened text was scraped off and new rules pasted there, accompanied by some rewiring. Reportedly, at least one or two operators in Nevada were known to do this to make the game less liberal. The cabinet has a multi-colored paint theme (probably \"Zolatone\") often used in Nevada to make the games all look the same.Another Zolatone cabinet pictured here has been modified to include a payout mechanism.Also pictured is an alternate backglass having naked ladies on it, among other differences. The Bally brand name has been replaced with the letters \"BGS\". We have no further information on this glass.Prior to the production of Bounty in August of 1963, Bally had been producing bingo machines at a pace of about 6 to 8 models per year until Shoot-A-Line of October 1962, after which they completely halted production of bingos. This action was in anticipation of the imminent passage of the Eastland Bill (S-1658, for James Eastland, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee) which would have outlawed the interstate transportation of gambling devices (per Billboard, Sept 15, 1962, page 34). One of the visible proponents for the Senate Bill was Rufus King, attorney for D. Gottlieb and Company. The Eastland Bill, formally known as the Gambling Devices Act of 1962, was signed by President Kennedy on October 18, 1962 and made effective 60 days later, in December 1962. Bally turned to the full-time production of pinball machines, a line for which they had made fewer than two dozen models from the end of WWII to 1958. They started with Moon Shot in January 1963, a blatant copy of Gottlieb's 1962 'Tropic Isle'. By June of 1963, Bally reported a drop in sales of 40 per cent since the passage of the Eastland Bill, due to the cutback of their bingo line (per Billboard, June 22, 1963, page 45). An amendment added to the Bill in final Senate-House conference committee allowed Bally to restart bingo production to ship overseas and to Louisiana and other unspecified stateside areas. Bounty was Bally's first bingo game once they restarted production of these machines. Bally continued to produce pinball machines and at a greater pace than they made new bingo games. Their last bingo game of which we are aware was 1980's Continental, its entire production run shipped to Belgium.",

Because bingo games were forbidden in Italy, this conversion kit was never advertised publicly, although the flyer does hint at it by stating \"Disponibile in due versioni\" (\"two versions available\"). Information about it was written in a sheet inside a game and carried by word of mouth. Reinstalling the original ROMs and backglass would restore the game to the original version.Thr flyer also indicates that operators would be able to change the playfield and game with future playfields and games, as kits, but the company did not stay in operation long enough to produce any future games or kits.In fact, Federico Croci, a collector in Italy, states this kind of conversion was not very successful. He recalls visiting Tecnoplay in the 1990s while they were throwing away unused backglasses and other parts, most of them for the bingo version of this game."

		"notes": "Ken Fedesna, Executive VP/General Manager over Williams/Bally/Midway from 1988 until their close of pinball production in 1999, provided us the following information:In looking through my Operation Meeting notes from back then, it turns out that we built 12 prototype test units, some of which were sent to various distributors. We also did release a sample run of 100, but the test results of the prototypes were not very promising, and we pulled back the sample run release before any were actually built. The game was originally intended to have four individually controlled flipper buttons, but when that didn't work out, we tried combining two flippers together, which is how mine is wired. However, this didn't work out either as far as game play and subsequently the earnings. The problem was that it was just too difficult to control the balls via the four flippers over the large vertical playfield.It was designed by an \"outside group\" made up of Eric Erickson and Dan Langlois (who later worked as an employee for us). James T. Hawes was a technical writer and technical support technician at Williams. He wrote the manual for this game when it was an EM prototype. In the Files section of this listing are extended comments from him about this game and about a similar game called \"Break Street\", as well as a reference to a game called \"Arena\". These last two games never made it to production and we have found no other information about them.Unlicensed distilleries (\"stills\") in the United States were predominant in the Appalachian United States from the late 19th century to the early 20th century, including the years of Prohibition (1920-1933). The product of these unlicensed stills was known as moonshine and the jugs that contained it would be labeled with an \"X\" for each time the moonshine batch had been run through the still. A jug marked \"XXX\" had been processed three times and was very close to being pure alcohol.We previously listed the date for this game as July 1985.Reportedly, three examples of this game are known to exist."

A concrete difference is found in the upper playfield where two painted stars appear in place of two star rollovers. Several inserts are different, with red ones substituted in a few places. The left outlane and inlane inserts do not state \"When Lit\" while the right outlane does, and this suggests after-factory replacement, or perhaps the manufacturer ran out of the correct ones during production, as has been believed to have happened on other games. However, the strongest suggestion of after-factory replacement of inserts is found in the bonus ladder where each insert has a thicker black border around it than the other game we show. Interestingly, the alignment of these bonus inserts seems to not follow a straight line, and while that may be an optical illusion given the art design involved, we notice the holes for the 3-4-5-6 inserts were not placed equidistantly."

The playfield looks very similar to the head-to-head games, with flippers at each end of the playfield protecting a goal. However, the presence of a standard backbox at one end of the cabinet requires both players to stand together at the other end in simultaneous play. The lockdown bar has a red button for the four red flippers and a white button for the four white flippers. A ninth flipper is in the very center of the playfield, positioned as if it would rotate, but how it performs is uncertain.There is no ball shooter knob on the cabinet. Pressing either flipper button starts the game. Goals are scored on the backglass for each team, Red or White. The image in this listing has a score card with only a partial statement in view, stating, \"Matching either Red or White goals to the 'Line-Up Score' awards one...\"  It is unclear whether this Line-Up Score operates during play, staying fixed or changing, and probably awarding replays as players' scores change, or if it provides only an end-of-game match for one replay.",
		"notes": "Our information conflicts as to whether only a few examples of this game were produced, or if this game ever went into production at all. Either way, as Model #62 it was intended to be a multiple-player game a full two years prior to Model #94 Gottlieb's 1954 'Super Jumbo', a 4-player game commonly known as Gottlieb's first electromechanical multiple-player game.Wayne Neyens tell us that, although he was the only designer at Gottlieb from 1949 to 1963, he did not design this game. He speculates that perhaps other engineers in the next room from his at Gottlieb put this game together.The image in this listing proves at least one example of 'Twin Hockey' was made. Notice its geometric cabinet art appears on Gottlieb's subsequent Model #68, Gottlieb's 1952 'Skill-Pool'."

He replied:Hi Boy was a six player pinball machine, I must have been out of my head. As I recall one game was made, it was a standard game, score reels, flippers etc. It was a beast to say the least. I am not sure we shipped it out or not, but I am fairly sure there was only one. The circuit for that game was something else, believe me.

My nephew went to Ohio State and when they graduated no one in the group wanted to take it with them.  He did not let me know for two years that he did not have it, and did not know what happened to it......We previously showed a date of January 1978 for this game. The Williams Daily Production Log first lists Jai Alai on March 14, 1977 as a 2-player machine with a quantity of 67 units authorized to be made. This game did not go into production but was made later as the solid state Williams' 1978 'Disco Fever' which also had the curved flippers."

The apron is a lighter green2. The inserts leading to the left ramp are 3-2-1 instead of M-A-P.3. The yellow arrow insert for the upper right saucer does not say 'Video'.4. The yellow insert pointing up the volcano ramp only says 'Collect' instead of '3X Collect'5. The scoops for the saucers are silver instead of black.6. The insert closest to the lower saucer says 'See Map' instead of just 'Map' and is purple instead of green.7. The 'Skill Fire' insert is green instead of purple.8. Red circuit boards all underneath the playfield.This test game is in a No Fear cabinet and still has the NF artwork on the backbox, but the lower cabinet is decaled with Congo. It has the WPC 95 boardset. It has the new style speaker grille but with the old style light board, not the shadow box style that the production games have. Also has production wire ramps, not black or unplated like some prototypes. Possibly these ramps, as well as the grille, were changed for the employee who bought it: Bill Grupp had indicated that employees who purchased such games tried to make their game as nice as possible before taking them home.",

Bally changed the trim to varnished wood to help promote the games for this overseas market. This second version is nicknamed 'Bonanza 2'.Both versions have the key lock at the top front of the trim. In contrast, the game in the flyer had its locks on the sides. We notice that the Bally bingo machines that precede 'Bonanza' have side-lock trim while the ones that followed 'Bonanza' have top-lock trim."

However, from all available printed information, this 1944 version did not have the year on the backglass. The glass pictured in this listing fits that assessment. The manufacturer stopped advertising the dated name \"World Series �43\" in Billboard beginning with their ad of 11/27/1943 p114 where, from this point forward, the game was listed among their other games as just 'World Series'. However, because the 1943 version was first advertised in Billboard on 10/31/1943 p61, it seems unlikely that Victory Games would remove or change the year on the glass as soon as November, after only one month�s time.  The context of their ads during the next several months does not make a strong case for a 1944 version until the ad of 04/15/1944 p74 where 'World Series' takes the headlined position in the ad with the words \"Operators � Here It Is � World Series\". Based on that ad, and until we have more information, we show the date for this listing as April, 1944. The last Billboard ad for this kit was 02/10/1945 p74."

What was obvious to them back then as to which game they were selling is less obvious to us now as we look for clues to determine when this 1944 'Follies' conversion first appeared.The earliest 1944 Billboard ad we found that specifically indicated it was a conversion of 'Follies' is a pictureless distributor ad dated July 22, 1944, page 79. The earliest P & S Machine Company ad referencing this 'Follies' conversion is dated Sept 2, 1944, page 80 and advertises that the game was already selling well. We found no P & S ads between July 22 and Sept 2, 1944, but during this interim we saw an increasing number of distributor ads specifying this 'Follies' conversion."

No serial number was found anywhere on the cabinet for this game, but the front edge of the playfield has a handwritten number 6178. We do not know if that number was placed there by the factory or by an operator.Two game owners have each reported that their games were factory-wired for 3-ball play only, pointing out there is no operator option for 5-ball play. That is likely how all the games in the run were made, because a section of the schematic (shown here) indicates a factory 3-ball setting.

In the picture, there is an extension of the backbox above the backglass, presumably for speakers or a light display.This game by I.D.I. is not to be confused with a very similar game Jac van Ham's 1986 'Ice Mania' which has all four backglass score displays in the lower half of the glass and has no backbox extension. The backglass art of the two games are nearly identical."

Some examples of this game had the Gottlieb backbox with the \"infinity lighting\" while others had a conventional backbox without this lighting.Claude Verpy, a collector in France and a good friend of the manufacturer, passed along this information:Christian Tabart told me that Le Grand 8 was based on Panthera and 100 machines were produced. Christian had the kits made and delivered to his workshops in Montgeron, France. Operators who were interested had to bring him the machine(s) they wanted to be transformed and the job was done by Christian's employees.If someone brought a Mars God of War or Volcano to convert, the backbox was kept as it was with the infinity lights. If it was another model, then there was only the new backglass to put in. The type of backbox depended on the machine that the operator provided.Shown in this listing are two stickers which Tabart affixed to the aprons of the machines he operated in bars to identify himself as the owner and to advertise his company.Agn�s Dusaugey did the artwork for the backglass and playfield. In our Files section is a letter from her describing how she got involved in the making of this game."

When the game on a certain top seems to lag - pep it up and make it an entirely new game by inserting a new top. Interchangeable tops are available for all tables in numerous designs at $5 each.While this ad states numerous tops existed for each of their three cabinet models of 'Skill Ball', the only picture ads we have found of their interchangeable tops show only three of them, pictured next to the three cabinet models, each top displayed in the ad to possibly suggest it belonged only to the cabinet model pictured nearest it. In the Encyclopedia of Pinball Volume 1, only three tops are listed in an Index, as 'Loop Top', 'Cross Top', and 'Board Top'.

One such ad is pictured in this listing.The marketing arm of this manufacturer was known as International Amusement Company, located at the same address.

		"notes": "According to The Complete Pinball Book, the optional photo unit mounted on the top of the backbox would take instant pictures of players whenever the high score was beaten. We don't know if any of these units have survived.This game was manufactured in Australia by Leisure & Allied Industries (LAI) under license from Stern Electronics. Of the several pinball machines that Stern licensed to LAI, it was the only one that Stern did not also make themselves. It used the same game ROMs as Stern's 1979 'Magic'.Stern's documentation indicates they shipped 336 knock-down games. While each manufacturer may have done it differently, such \"kits\" would typically consist of everything except the cabinet and playfield glass, items that would be procured locally by the receiving party.Pictured here are two versions of backglasses, one with licensing information and one without. We don�t know the reason for this difference.Also pictured here are playfields with two different compositions of plywood. One version shows all plies to be a lighter-colored wood. A checklist is stapled on its underside and dated 8-24-79 by \"Joe Vega\". The other version is of a stripped playfield and shows an alternating light and dark wood, identified by a local woodworker as maple (light) and probably poplar (dark). Its checklist is undated and carries the initials \"LSO\". We don't know the reason for the two compositions. If Joe Vega can be identified as a Stern employee in Chicago at that time, this would confirm that the playfield was part of the shipped knock-down game. It is a theory that the maple-poplar playfield was made in Australia.We also don't know how much of the internal mechanisms were produced locally, if any, but the cabling to include the Australian 240V 3-pin service outlet was likely made in Australia.The LAI factory was located in the city of Perth, in the state of Western Australia.Stern's manufacturer data for Cosmic Princess:Production Start Date: 8/20/79Production End Date: 9/19/79Quantity produced - full games: noneQuantity produced - knock-down games: 336Total Quantity Produced: 336"

The backglass shows a portion of the Oakland Bay Bridge in the right foreground. In the center is the Fair itself, located on Treasure Island, a man-made island completed in 1939. The Fair was open February-October 1939 and May-September 1940. In April 1941, Treasure Island became a Naval Station in anticipation of American involvement in World War II.Based on the above information, we presume this game was made between 1939 and 1941."

Five playfield lanes each have four rollovers to equal the twenty holes in the pop-up array. To complete a needed sequence in the array, the ball on the playfield must pass through the correspondingly marked lane to hit the one \"live\" rollover out of the four in that lane. Reshuffling of the ten balls does not occur when sequences are completed in this way. The lower playfield inserts will light to show up to 10 sequences made. Completing two sequences light the lower bumpers, completing six will light the upper bumpers, nine will light the outlanes for Special (one replay) and the gobble hole for Special (3 replays).When two players play, Player 1 plays an entire game before Player 2 is up, allowing the sequences earned to carry-over from ball to ball.",
		"notes": "'Flying Aces' was the last game from this manufacturer.  We have found Genco-sponsored ads for this game only in an International Section of Cash Box magazine from 1958, and these ads were printed in German, Spanish, French, and Italian. The Spanish ad shown here indicates that the game was available in both replay and novelty models.This game was generally unknown in the USA until \"found\" in Australia in the mid-1990's. In a featured article in the March 1997 PinGame Journal, the author wrote that two of these games were imported into Western Australia in the 1950's or early 1960's after being purchased from a dealer in California. While one of the games was in \"fine condition\", the other had been previously stripped of parts and was quite worn.The author also pointed out that the schematic is undated and that the reverse side of the backbox mirror was stamped with a 10-year guarantee starting June 12, 1956. This may have been why we originally showed a 1956 date for this game. However, Steve Kordek's list of Genco games places Flying Aces as their last one produced, and he indicated a date of \"July 07, 1958\".The Cash Box ads appearing in four languages show us that Genco marketed this game to Europe. As of mid-2000, one was located in Australia and three were in the USA. We previously showed a Production Count of \"4\" but have since removed it, because we really do not know how many of these games were made (and exported)."

Until we know what became of those other four solid state models mentioned above, this solid state Continental classifies as Bally's last full production bingo game. The entire production run was shipped to Belgium.A subsequent bingo game, Bally's 1981 'Mississippi Showboat', was made as EM but only test games were made and did not go into full production.This 25-hole SS Continental is not to be confused with their EM game, Bally's 1978 'Continental', which has a different backglass design and 18 holes."

The menagerie ball, a large plastic ball trapped within a cage above the left slingshot, can be hit by the ball in play and disrupts ball direction. The Ringmaster is an animated head that elevates from the underside of the playfield and makes wise cracks at the player, who tries to defeat him by hitting him with the pinball in various modes. A stop magnet is on the top of the Ringmaster's head, holding the ball there when the head rises up. The \"Boom Balloon\" pop bumper (on the lower right side of the playfield) is a disappearing bumper, dropping down until its flat plastic top is level with the playfield. The backbox animation simulates a cannonball fired to ring a bell, although the bell is really just a piece of plastic with a bell drawn on it. This animation is mostly activated automatically by the game, but one feature allows the player to continuously fire the cannonball using the flipper buttons in a timed mini-game. Points are given if the ball takes a certain path in the fall (this path having a switch).",
		"notes": "This is the first SS game to have a disappearing pop bumper. Several EM games have this feature. The first one is Williams' 1958 'Gusher'.This is the only Williams pinball machine with its dot matrix display mounted \"on\" the playfield instead of in the backbox. The only other pinball with the DMD mounted on the playfield is Capcom's 1996 'Flipper Football'.The neon tube was produced in a variety of colors. Reportedly, the menagerie ball was also produced in a variety of colors, usually matching the neon's color.The sample game pictured in this listing has several playfield differences from the production games that followed.

Although we can't be sure when the production actually started, or when actually changed from 1st series to 2nd series, I believe it would be wise to change production year from 1965 to at least 1967.A second-series game not shown here has been found in Italy with cabinet art having diamond-shaped parallelograms matching the cabinet art believed to be unique to Bally's 1967 'Boot-A-Ball'."

The billiard players on lower playfield appeared earlier on Williams' 1966 '8 Ball' and the two games have similar backglass artwork.Reportedly, this game is one of a few pinball machines to feature Italian language on the backglass as well as on the playfield. For example, \"Palle in gioco\" (Balls to play) and \"Punti\" (Score, written under the score drums).Dario Morlacchi of Italy sent us this information about his father's participation in the conception of this game:Coming off of the success of RMG's 1973 'Strike', in 1974 Europlay made a large run of 10,000 units of Sky Star, a copy of Gottlieb's 1974 'Sky Dive'. Only about 2,000 sold, and Mr. Montanari, the company owner, approached operator Luciano Morlacchi for help to sell the remaining 8,000 units. Mr. Morlacchi advised to change the artwork of Gottlieb's 1969 'Bumper Pool' and make a new game, using parts from the 8,000 units of Sky Star. The new game, Tic & Toc, was so successful that an additional 10,000 units were made using brand new parts.One of the games pictured here illustrates that the backglass is not silkscreened in the area of the pool table to allow light to pass through the glass yet there are five light bulb sockets wired from the manufacturer in that area of the backbox insert."

The kit also added a very basic sound board with a speaker instead of chimes. The credit and match score reels had digital numbers painted on them. Presumably, the kit was made by the manufacturer if it was installed by them, but we cannot yet confirm this.Keops (or Cheops) is a reference to King Cheops of Egypt or to the pyramid built for him."

Under the cardholder, the playfield is labeled Sleic - TABLERO \"iO \"- 1� NEGRO  (translated: \"Table No. 1 Black\").Also pictured in this listing is a game with images attributed to both Miranda and Giovannone.

		"notes": "The payout mechanism used in this game was invented by brothers Henry W. Seiden and Herman L. Seiden.According to an Automatic Age article quoted in the Encyclopedia of Pinball Vol 2, this improved game had \"an entirely new type of coin mechanism\" than did Bally's 1933 'Rocket'. It came in a battery-operated model as well as a plug-in AC model, having a motor that operated on either AC or DC. By May 1934, models came with a check separator to operate on cash or tokens and payout in tokens only.In the Encyclopedia of Pinball Vol 2, Author Dick Bueschel writes: \"There was one other change that never showed up in the advertising, and for which no flyer was prepared. The original ROCKET has a large red and chrome \"R\" emblem on its side over a black cabinet. On the NEW IMPROVED ROCKET the new cabinet removes the logo device and replaces it with chrome trim lines in varied colored cabinets. That's how operators knew they had new or refurbished games.\"The sole photograph in this listing shows the cabinet art design that appears to be the undocumented cabinet style of the Improved version.  The 1934 Coin Machine Journal ad shown in this listing explains the various mechanical improvements to this game even while it still shows the cabinet of the original version."

The title of the Billboard article shown here excluded their earlier counter game, Signal.According to the Encyclopedia of Pinball Vol 2, this was the first light-up game from this manufacturer. In this book, author Dick Bueschel writes the game name as one word, Lighthouse. This may be because printed references use the single word, which is the correct English spelling.No manufacturer name was evident on the game pictured here, but its ball shooter gauge appears identical to the one on Scientific Machine Corporation's 1936 'Jimmy Valentine' and so we have placed this picture here. Because the playfield shows the game name as two capitalized words, we have modified this listing name to match."

From this, we believe this non-payout game came in two models, and this Model E22 was a second version that they were announcing. We list here its most dependable characteristics that will distinguish it from the first model:The game name at top of playfield is displayed on a ribbon banner.Below the name, the horses race to the right.The playfield is three colors with chevron borders between them.The center of race track in lower playfield has numbers in it.The coin slide has a round single-coin view window.The first model is Evans' 1935 'Kings of the Turf (First Model)'."

The prototype that is on the right that you can barely see had very large holes cut out of the sides of the cabinet so it could be accessed while the playfield was still down.  The same goes for the missing front door.  We did mostly mechanical assembly and layout testing on it. It was near impossible to make the ramp shot from the upper left flipper. That was how you loaded the balls into the lock and was also the jackpot shot. Michael (Gottlieb) wasn't happy about the shot not making it around and Wally (Welch) tried everything he could with flipper placement. It just wasn't going to happen without redrawing and retooling the ramp.  There was no way that we would have had a new ramp and the game ready for the ACME show that was only three weeks away. No production games were made. I know this as I purchased the prototypes when AG went out of business."

		"notes": "The physical measurements of this game were originally given to us unconfirmed as 4 feet by 10 feet, and one picture in this listing shows it was equipped with a coin door. The Play Meter article quotes a Bally representative as saying the possibility existed that this giant game could go into production if interest was there.According to GameRoom magazine articles:This game started as a handmade prototype game made by designers Ron Halliburton and Jack Pearson of Arcade Engineering, with artwork by Roland Berrios. Jack said Bally sent them a game to work with in creating this prototype. Jim Patla stated he was pretty certain the game sent was Bally's 1975 'Bow and Arrow' based on playfield similarities between the two games. Arcade Engineering submitted the prototype to Bally for consideration to put it into production. Jim said only two Bigfoot games were made by Bally although extra backglasses were also made. Jim checked with Margaret Hudson who told him neither she nor Paul Faris did the art for the Bally version (as previously believed), but that it was done by Dick White and his brother (both were staff artists). A 1985 legal document recorded the playfield as being 4 feet by 8 feet.Bally decided not to put this game into production and it went back to Arcade Engineering, who then sold the rights to Atari, who then made their giant game Atari's 1979 'Hercules'.We asked Allan Reizman, Engineering Lab Supervisor at Bally from 1977 to 1983, to talk about why this game did not go into production and what Atari may have done differently than Bally in producing their Hercules game. He replies: Bigfoot was well into development when I arrived at Bally as a lab intern in 1977. We had received a field test game a few weeks before that I think came from the Great America Amusement Park near Chicago and that had been used the previous season. One of my first tasks was to pick up the pieces (literally) of that game and determine why it failed. Once I had the game partially assembled, the flaws were pretty obvious. The game had shaken itself apart! When one of the thumper bumpers would go \"kerchunk\", the vibrations would cause all the lamps to burn out! Besides the lamp failures, the cabinet was separating at the seams, the coils were breaking loose, wires had become separated, and on and on. The fatal design flaw was building Bigfoot to the same standards as a normal sized pin. What soon became obvious was that oversized components such as the bumpers put out double the vibration and double the stress on the body. Screws needed to be larger. Cabinet seams needed to be stronger. Every connection needed to be substantially reinforced to withstand the stresses of such a game.  Atari did things a bit differently with Hercules. First off, it was solid state. The controlled direct current of solid state games allowed for a smoother and less violent bumping action of the coils. Next, they free-mounted many of their lamps which, when combined with regulated DC, gave them longer life. Atari also improved and mounted their components in a more shock-resistant manner. All in all, Hercules was far more successful as a trial of the larger-than-life pin.Unfortunately, these games were unsuccessful financially and the jumbo pinball experiment died. While all the engineering issues could be fixed, albeit at greater cost and weight, the marketing failures could not be overcome. The games were just impractical. Too large and heavy to build and ship, and too limited a market where they could be deployed. If it could have been proven the cashbox earnings justified the cost and space required to put one of these games on location, things might have turned out differently. But even at a hefty 50 cents per play (twice the game play price at the time), the games did not garner significantly more cashbox earnings than a regular-sized pin. An operator could put 3 or 4 other games in the same space and earn 3-4 times the income.Today, you have to have a lot of space and commitment to set up one of these in a collection. When we moved our offices from Belmont Avenue in Chicago to Bensenville, I found a stack of the Plexiglas backglasses in the old lab building and hung one on my wall at home for years. Unfortunately, I sold it at a Chicagoland show some years ago and now I regret doing so. It was quite a conversation starter.Jack Pearson credits Ron Halliburton with the conception of the the Giant Pinball idea and as the designer of this game. He also shares with us the following information:To reduce the development time and cost, Bally sent us a new pinball game from their production line before we started work on Bigfoot. We played and studied that game until we understood how the game logic worked. For example, hit targets A, B, and C, then the target D doubles when hit. By understanding the game logic, we could create a new table layout without having to redesign the electronics.  There were limitations when doing a new table layout. For example, if the Bally Pinball had 3 thumper bumpers, our table had to have a max of 3. However, we could reposition the thumper bumpers. The flippers and thumper bumpers required much more power than the Bally game so we had to build our own more powerful solenoids.Bally sent us one of their production pinballs. We gutted that game, taking the electronic and wiring harness. We took the harness and electronics and put that in Bigfoot.I rented a U-haul and personally drove the truck from our facility in Florida to deliver the prototype to Bally. After a few months, Bally decided they did not want to put the game into production and returned the prototype to us (Arcade Engineering). We, in turn, then licensed the game to Atari and shipped the prototype to them. I do not remember how many they produced. I do know the game had to be re-engineered as the prototype was designed just to test and many parts were one of a kind hand made.'Bigfoot' appeared on a USA television special \"US Against The World\" in which celebrities from the USA competed in different sports with celebrities from the UK and the rest of the world. This NBC-TV special originally aired on Wednesday, September 7th, 1977. A different backglass was used on this show.If you own one of these two games, or know someone who does, please contact us."

Flipping a ball on the lower playfield up the left center ramp delivers it to the Ring 2 playfield where its one flipper is used to flip the ball up a ramp to the elephant's trunk. The elephant then raises its head to roll the ball along its trunk to the habitrail behind it, routing the ball to the Ring 3 playfield. This playfield has one small flipper and a mini-slingshot kicker in place of a left flipper. A skillful shot up the rear ramp of this playfield delivers the ball to a magnetic ball lifter which elevates it to fall into the clown's playfield. Two small flippers on this final playfield are used to score the three drop targets and to score a jackpot behind them. After jackpot, the ball is returned via habitrail to the right flipper on the lower playfield.",

The other unit is in a private collection.There is knowledge of a Pinball Circus that had shipped to Germany, suggesting three games were made. We asked Ken Fedesna, former Executive VP/General Manager over Williams/Bally/Midway from 1988 until their close of pinball production in 1999, if he could clarify how many were made. He replies:I looked through my Operation Meeting notes from 1992, 1993, and 1994 concerning Pinball Circus, and found that we only built 2 Engineering prototypes total. One was sent to test in Germany, but it was returned. Not sure whether it is the one Steve Kordek had that is now in Vegas, or the other one, but my notes clearly indicate that only 2 were ever built."

Reportedly these games left the factory with the kits installed. We cannot yet confirm if this kit was made and/or installed by the manufacturer.Our Additional Media section links to a video of this game being played. It has visible EM score reels indicating the above kit was not used, yet one can hear electronic sound that the kit would produce. A collector in Spain explains that it is common there to mix parts from various games due to parts scarcity, and this could be the reason for the electronic sound in this particular game."

The plates were supposed to be affixed to every game (first game made to have plate number 001, 50th game made to have number 050, etc.) but the plates were late in the making and 70% of the games were shipped out to distributors before anybody realized the plates had not caught up with the games. Williams ended up giving the plates to distributors to match up to the games each had received, but in the end some distributors received the plates and some did not. The rush to switch over to Pinball 2000 may have been a factor in this.A hobbyist reports that there is a test mode for Saloon Doors on his production game, a playfield feature that was on prototype games but did not make it to production games.",

Was also available as a conversion kit for Revenge From Mars.Last game manufactured by WMS industries (Williams and Bally labels) before the announcement to close their doors on October 25, 1999. The jet bumper rule of the 1.4 software reminds players of that date. (The number of points for spelling Jar Jar is 19,992,510; This is the date 25-10-1999, the same day WMS announced the closing of their pinball branch.)Ted Estes, a former WMS employee has a story about buying and manufacturing the second to last Williams pinball machine built in the 20th century: http://www.softwarecrafters.com/starwars/index.html.According to Kevin O'Connor at the 2004 Texas Pinball Festival, the Darth Maul character in the video sequence is actually Kevin himself, who trained for several weeks in stick fighting so he could be filmed against a green screen and appear in the game.A number of the final cabinets made for this game had plaques affixed to them indicating sequentially numbered games up to a quantity of 5100. We do not know how many of these cabinets had such plaques, but a number of 200 (unconfirmed to us) is floating around in general discussion. Other cabinets had a different plaque for \"The Final Collector's Series of 100\". Duncan Brown tells us that these type of plaques were used to move the final inventory out the door at full price, and this was done by manufacturing facility people long after all of the engineering people were let go, the engineering people being the ones most likely to care about this sort of thing, therefore exact numbers for each plaque may not be known, in spite of what numbers the plaques might show. For instance, there could be two series of \"100\" plaques, for all we know. Perhaps the difficult task of locating and counting available plaques would be necessary to estimate their quantities. In contrast to our stated Production Run number of 3,525 units, Duncan believes they made 5100 units (plus playfield kits), but he remembers being told the number was more like 5,103.Shown in this listing is a one-off game having a gold cabinet. Duncan tells us it was made just like any other game, but with a gold laminate on the cabinet parts instead of the usual black, before the art was applied. It has serial number 5371, a number that he believes was fabricated and not indicative of the total number of games made. He thinks they merely added 200 to the serial number of the last game they saw, since they knew they were done with production and would never reach that number. If he is correct, a quick mathematical subtraction points to 5,171 games made, but Duncan allows that not all serial numbers may have been used to arrive at that number. For instance, if something as trivial as a serial number label printer jammed, they would just skip over the affected numbers and move on.The Dupont Chromalin prototype playfield laminate shown in this listing has pink outlines around the artwork. Production playfields had yellow. Other minor difference are that Anakin�s Hair is yellow and the letters JEDI are outlined in pink."

A carousel of three kick-out holes rotates when activated by a ball going up the left ramp and arriving at the elevated right-side cannon. Pressing flipper buttons fires the cannon ball to the rotating carousel. If the timing is right, the ball will lock in one of the three kick-out holes. Locking three balls in the carousel starts multiball. A cannon ball missing an empty carousel hole will be diverted back into play. The carousel kicks out all locked balls at end of a player's turn; locked balls do not carry-over.",

Data East (now Sega) gave him permission to build the second machine that is shown here. The sound system consisted of several short sound effects plus a very long sample of Kabuki music.Built from a Data East 1994 'The Who's Tommy Pinball Wizard'.Joe Kaminkow stated at the Chicago Expo 2012 that the artwork for this game was done by Markus Rothkranz."

Thus, Ace was now making a copy of a copy, and was no longer directly copying the Bally game.This game was inexplicably misspelled as 'Jiggolo' in at least one advertisement of the time and may be listed this way in other pinball resources.This game was also produced as a conversion kit in December, 1932.

Each solitary drop target has a mini-post screw behind it, most likely there to protect the target backside from ball damage but they also serve to deflect balls shot from the flippers when these targets are down.Three pop bumpers are on a revolving turntable.

Sometimes the turntable automatically changes its direction of rotation.The rebound rubbers adjacent to the flippers are not slingshots. This game has only one slingshot kicker strategically placed in the middle right side of the playfield. Three lit (or always flashing?) yellow arrow inserts direct the player to shoot the ball from the left flipper to this slingshot to be kicked across the playfield to the 2-way kick-out hole in a left lane above the drop target bank. This starts the bonus kick-out feature to award 5000 to 20000 bonus points and opens the Free Ball Gate, the only time this gate opens. Normally, the ball is kicked upward from this hole to the top of the playfield but in the bonus mode the ball is kicked across the playfield towards the top entrance of the long right-side lane where the Free Ball Gate delivers it back to the shooter lane. Before the ball is kicked-out, however, the turntable is activated just long enough to move the pop bumpers out of the ball's anticipated path across the playfield.See also the annotated flyer close-up image that accompanies this description.",

All four drop targets must be hit to qualify the one standup target behind them. Three pop bumper caps are amusement park bumper cars.The Magnetic House is a two-tiered device on an elevated mini-playfield and is fed via habitrail by a VUK in the upper right corner of the main playfield. The ball enters the top tier of this device (the clown's face) and falls through his mouth to the lower tier, which is spinning clockwise. There are three holes in this lower tier, and the ball falling into any one of them is actually held in place in that hole and dragged clockwise with the disc until it reachs the twelve o'clock position at which it drops down to the mini-playfield surface. Once there, two diverter magnets (visible in the red rectangular area) are ready to be activated by a second (lower) set of flipper buttons. The player can use the magnets to swerve the ball left or right to direct it downfield to one of three lock holes.This game can allow up to four balls in multiball as follows: The player shoots the ball in play into a wire \"extra ball\" ramp located in the center upper playfield which loops the ball up and around to a \"teeter-totter\" ball diverter. The diverter is slanted to roll the ball to the right and into a captive ball lane, \"locking\" the ball there and issuing another ball to play. The captive ball, if struck by the new ball in play, moves upward into a sinkhole, down a subway ramp, then is kicked out of the haunted house to join the ball in play as multiball. This sequence can be repeated until four balls are in simultaneous play. Only one ball at a time can \"lock\" in the captive ball lane. Whenever that lane has a ball in it, the diverter then slants to the left, sending any subsequent balls that are shot up the wire ramp to roll down on the raised mini-playfield."

If the player picked the right club, they'd end up on the green. Then they'd have to \"putt\" the ball into the indicated shot.Players could also accidentally hit the ball into a sand trap or water hole for a penalty.Like golf, the goal of the game was to finish the hole in the fewest \"shots\" possible. Good players would get done more quickly, but would win a prize (a golf ball) if they did well enough.The game had a novelty-style cabinet like Sega's 1997 'Roach Racers' or Sega's 1997 'Derby Daze' - no legs.",

Freres does not recall the distributor's specific reason for the name change or how it actually affected the Black Belt production run, and offers the possibility that all games shipped as Black Belt and then Bally shipped the new glasses later.It could be that the name was changed for Europe to avoid confusion with Zaccaria's 1986 'Blackbelt' released a few months before.We presume the Production Run quantity of 600 for Black Belt includes the games having the Karate Fight backglasses."

		"features": "Reclined backbox. Backglass light animation (basketball players move around court and score baskets).This is a one-player game with two scoring sequences, the Blue Team and the Red Team.  Five balls per game, using one or two coins. The first coin starts the game and lites the words 'Blue Team' on the backglass. The player can choose to insert a second coin at this time to lite the words 'Red Team' as well. There are 14 yellow bumpers, 3 blue bumpers, and 3 red bumpers. These bumpers, when hit, lite animated basketball players on the backglass to move across the court and score baskets.Game play:At the start of each game, an animated player is shown in the \"start\" position on the backglass. The yellow bumpers are live, while the blue and red bumpers are dead. To score a basket for either team, any five of the yellow bumpers must first be hit. Each \"yellow hit\" causes the backglass animation sequence to step just once, and the animated player is shown in stop-motion, moving in and between the stationary players on the backglass. Once the animation has reached the fifth step, the yellow bumpers cease to advance (they go dead) and the blue and red bumpers become live. If the ball in play next hits a blue bumper, an automated seven-step sequence begins, showing the animated player heading towards the right-side basket, and he sinks the ball through it, scoring for the Blue Team. However, if a red bumper was hit instead, then the animated player is shown heading towards the left-side basket and scores it for the Red Team. Only one blue or red bumper need be hit to initiate the automatic stepping sequence, which takes approximately two seconds to complete.After a basket is scored, the yellow bumpers are live again, the red and blue bumpers are dead again, the animated player is back at his start position, and game play continues. It is possible to have the same ball in play hit a live blue or red bumper, score a basket, and still be in play to hit the yellow bumpers once they go live again.A ball falling through either the Red Team rollover or the Blue Team rollover in lower playfield will automatically score a basket for that Team, even if the prerequisite five yellow bumpers have not been achieved. This is done using a shortened animated sequence, which is actually the last three steps of the longer animation sequence, and shows the ball sinking through the hoop.The playfield bottom has five ball traps and one OUT trough. A skillful shot from the plunger sending a ball through the top rollover will return to the player all balls sitting in the OUT trough. The balls in the traps can only be released upon insertion of a coin to start a new game.If a second coin is not inserted at start of game, the Red Team bumpers and animation sequence still operate during play, and the Red Team score still increments on the backglass. However, because the words 'Red Team' are not lit, the Instructions indicate that its score does not \"count\".  Since there are no replays to win and no payout mechanism of any kind, perhaps the player's incentive to insert a second coin was based on a wholesome enjoyment of the game, or maybe anticipation of under-the-counter payouts by the location owner.",
		"notes": "The backglass pictures were photographed to illustrate each step of the animation sequence for the yellow, blue, and red bumpers. They do not represent an actual game in progress, therefore the Red Team lamp in the backglass and the Team scores may not track logically across the sequences.Also shown is the clever backbox mechanism for automating the seven-step animation sequence. A ball in channel device is mounted at an incline. Each time the stepper unit is energized, the ball is kicked up the channel and, when it rolls back down, it activates a switch to step the unit again, which kicks the ball back uphill again, etc. This continues until the animation sequence has completed.The cabinet has been repainted by the owner to match the evident original color and artwork.These patents were referenced on the Instruction card:Patent 1973814 [GAME APPARATUS] filed May 23, 1934 and granted Sept 18, 1934 to C.R. Kirk.Patent\t2012518 [GAME APPARATUS] filed Dec 5, 1934 and granted Aug 27, 1935 to Joseph W. Orcutt, Harry A. Stearns, and Thomas L. Wall."

The artists, Mychael Gerstenberger and Ralf Kr�ling, completed the artwork in 1984.This machine was co-produced by Bally Wulff and by MALBUCH art studio, both of Berlin, for their client \"Zentrale Werbeagentur, Berlin\" (an advertising agency) and for the Ecology Board of the \"Umweltbundesamt\" (Federal Environmental Agency).MALBUCH made prints of the artwork in the required size and put each piece in the individual machines that were supplied by Bally to Bally Wulff Berlin.

In one-player mode the machine pitches automatically. In two-player mode, one player selects from one of three styles of pitches (fastball, curveball, and knuckleball) while the other player bats. Reportedly, the ball is pitched at a high speed.The bat lever is entirely mechanical thus there is no delay in operation as there is with electromechanical bats where after pressing the bat button one must wait a second for a switch to tell a coil to fire. The speed of the bat depends only on how fast and how hard the player depresses the bat handle.According to a Billboard article dated Feb-28-1948 page 97, this game was introduced to the trade at the Coin Machine Industries show in Chicago, in January 1948."

Its pendulum tilt mechanism is mounted on the cabinet bottom. The second game only allows inside access by raising the playfield and the pendulum tilt is mounted to the playfield underside, not the cabinet bottom. These differences may be indicative of separate production runs with separate run dates. The second game is coined for old francs and operates on 220v. We don't know if all games came from the German factory as 220v or if this one was modified for France. The backglass when not lit shows only one airplane. An owner stated the backglass light animation consists of lighting this one airplane, plus nine more airplanes that can only be seen when lit, for a total of ten airplanes in the animation feature. We have pictures for only nine of the ten lit airplanes."

		"notes": "A copy of Gottlieb's 1972 'Flying Carpet'.Unlike other Italian-made games, this one has a replay wheel and no definite provisions for add-a-ball play. The backbox does not have the five extra lights for discreetly counting extra balls, as would be typical of Italian add-a-ball games. Although the apron is designed for a game having an outhole kickup for playing off extra balls, the underside of the playfield shows no outhole gate and kicker that a kickup game would have. The playfield also shows lights under the instruction card for 5-ball play, a system of counting which precludes add-a-balls. Yet, between the flippers underneath is a long plug whose function reportedly is to allow the operator to select between replay and add-a-ball play. We do not know if the dummy zero in the score was an alteration by the operator from a 4-digit game, a practice common in Italy. In support of this possibility, the black area of the backglass around the score reels does appear to cover up the pillars in the artwork drawn to hold up the arches. If RMG made this game as 4-digit scoring, then the silkscreened numbers 0 through 9 in the backglass would make sense as match numbers for the replay wheel. If RMG designed this as 5-digit, then to have also designed single-digit match numbers would be peculiar. There are bulbs present in the backbox for these numbers, and it is possible that the operator allowed them to continue to perform as the match feature, after having added a dummy zero, but now it would be for the 'tens' digit of the final score."

The backglass had windows for only two score displays while the backbox insert had the cutouts for third and fourth player displays, minus those displays.Greg Kmiec told us that Grand Slam was made as an \"economy\" game, meaning that there wasn't a lot of extra money put into the game, neither in design nor promotion.In the Files section is the April 1983 issue of Bally Midway Monitor, a newsletter sent to operators and distributors. It reports that Grand Slam debuted at the Amusement Operator's Expo the previous month which was March 25-27, 1983 at the O�Hare Exposition Center in Chicago. The text reads \"Grand Slam can take on 2 or 4 players, When the 4-Player option is used, the readout shows the 1st and 2nd players' runs while they play and flashes the runs for the 3rd and 4th players when it's their turn at bat.\" The accompanying photo shows the 4-player game. Tim Arnold told us that this game was originally a 2-player but they were not selling well so Bally made the last part of the production run as 4-player (backglass has four score windows for the four score displays). We have only a single production run quantity of 1000 units which likely includes both 2-player and 4-player quantities. We note that a single Model Number 1311 represents both versions. Tim said this game was made in the Midway plant using the Midway serial numbering system which starts at the number 1. For instance, serial number 124 is the 124th game produced. If Tim�s information is correct, then eventually having enough serial numbers in evidence should be useful to determine when during the production run the games converted from having only 2 score displays to having 4 displays.The only Installation Manual that we have contains a backbox wiring diagram showing pinouts for \"optional\" Player 3 and Player 4 connectors. (We present it in the 4-player listing.) If we assume that Bally/Midway did not know sales of this 2-player version would be so poor, to have pre-printed for each 2-player game a manual that would contain these optional pinouts, then perhaps two versions of this manual exist. If anyone has an original Grand Slam manual or backbox wiring diagram that does not evidence a third or fourth player, please contact us. Any additional original 2-player documentation is welcome.**We had previously indicated here that this game uses an AS-2888-51 sound board, unlike other 4th Generation Bally games which use a \"Squawk and Talk\". However, the Instruction Manual lists the sound board as AS-2518-51. A game owner reports that his 2-player game uses an AS-2518-51 sound board, an AS-2518-147 solenoid/lamp driver combo board, and the MPU is AS-2518-133."

Federico Croci, a collector in Italy, tells us that he has never seen this game there other than a picture or two in some operator's magazines.The game pictured here had a paper tag tied to the bank reset relays that stated \"Engineering Sample #5105\". Extra balls were counted on the backglass using what would have been the match numbers 1 thru 9 in a replay version. Extra balls were known as \"kick-ups\" because they entered the playfield through the flippers by being kicked-up from the out-hole. Kick-ups would have to be played off by the player who earned them before the game would advance to the next player.The two ball guides, one on each side of the Ball Saver, are not present in the U.S. version of this game. They likely were added to guide the path of kick-up balls.'Gun Smoke' is the first pinball machine by an American manufacturer to have the familiar round up-post between the flippers. Chicago Coin referred to this feature as the Ball Saver. The first known example is found on Rally's 1967 'Playboy'. An earlier, V-shaped form of this device was used by Gottlieb during the 1950's. An example is Gottlieb's 1950 'Knock Out'. The Gun Smoke flash feature on the backglass was first used on Chicago Coin's 1967 'Twinky'."

The black square in playfield center overlaps the arching words \"Made in the United States of America\". This appears a bit makeshift, as does perhaps the backglass art to an extent, but if this game was a conversion by another company, intended for commercial sale, the black square should have also covered up the Stoner name appearing below it.The game pictured here is the only example of which we are aware. We find no information or contemporary advertising for it. Stoner is supposed to have closed business in 1941 and its last games for which there is documentation were produced beginning in August of that year. It could be that 'Air Raid' was one of their very last games, in the throes of their shutdown, and dwindling finances may have disallowed them from advertising it well.The apparent necessity for any company to reuse this playfield, along with having a backglass theme of actual combat, suggests this game was made after December 7, 1941, when the surprise bombing of Pearl Harbor brought the United States into World War II. If Stoner did in fact make this game, they surely would have made more than one, to have made it worth their while, and unless their response to the news of Pearl Harbor was remarkably swift, it could have pushed Stoner's operation into 1942. However, for them to make a production run out of a 1938 playfield does not seem likely when one notices that by 1941 Stoner had advanced beyond those plain playfields of 1938, with passive bumpers now made of plastic instead of the older spring ones, and their artwork more sophisticated (curves instead of straight lines). Compare 'Air Raid' with the higher quality of Stoner's 'Click', a game made by Stoner where its production in their last months of business is more certain.The War Production Board's ban of the production of amusement games began March 16, 1942, a decision which precipitated the war-time pinball machine conversions. Stoner is supposed to have been well out of business by this time. If 'Air Raid' was one of these war-time conversions done by some other company, then again we would expect more than a few made, and their manufacture would be pointless without some form of advertising. More research is needed to discover contemporary advertising in support of this.Until then, we will identify the manufacturer as unknown."

It was created for use in the 1988 Paramount Pictures R-rated movie \"The Accused\" in a pivotal scene where Jodie Foster as Sarah Tobias is attacked on this pinball table.This game was purchased in 2008 through an auction in southern California from the film's editor who had owned it for twenty years. It has matching serial numbers on the cabinet and backbox. The backbox was heavily damaged by water. Some of the game's paperwork was still in the cabinet.The current game owner offers these additional details:The translite is thinner plastic than a normal translite and is attached to the outside of a piece of clear plastic that replaced the normal glass. It was attached with black fabric tape at the edges. I also included some pictures of extra lights added behind the translite. The playfield glass was also replaced with plastic, probably for safety reasons during filming. If you look at the playfield photos you can see three spots about one inch in diameter in a triangle pattern. I think clear plastic rods about three inches long were glued to the playfield on those spots to support the plastic during filming. I am not positive about this, but I have one clear plastic rod that came with the machine and it is a good fit. It is a little bigger diameter than the marks on the playfield and matching area of the playfield plastic.  If you look closely you can see that the playfield plastics are clear plastic with paper decals glued on the top. I guess you can't expect top quality in a movie prop. It has been very interesting so far and fun to look over such a unique piece of pinball history. The subject matter in the movie makes it a little difficult to explain to people the significance of this machine. However it was based on a real story that happened on a real pinball machine and this is what they chose as the movie prop for filming the scene. I hope people will understand that and not be offended by any restoration of this machine."

Slingshot \"rubbers\" are actually metal springs, which act as contacts.Flippers are interconnected (non-independent), and powered by the same solenoid.  Flippers also appear 3\" long, but their fulcrum point is further inward than typical, making their action similar to a 2\" flipper.

Your goal is to knock down the homophobe drop targets and spell \"get it girl\" to lock the balls in multi-ball. When two balls are locked, your face appears on the video monitor with any one of various wigs superimposed over it. Using the flipper buttons, you are able to scroll through a dozen different hairdos until you find one that you like. That image is captured and you play multi-ball. Locking the balls again allows you to digitally apply make-up and lipstick to your image. All the while, a disco sound track keeps the action going!",

After a few models, Martina began sawing off the lowered cabinet section to modernize the look of the machine and to make it more attractive.A different source tells us that Martina used for their conversion whatever used cabinets they had available or could get, whether the cabinets had the drop-down front or not.More information is needed to confirm what Martina did or didn't do regarding their cabinets.We believe the Gottlieb card holder shown in the game pictured here was added by a collector/restorer.

They predicted the machine would be a top-seller, and for their next machines they would get in touch with stars such as Rod Stewart and Eddie Money.**R&B singer Southside Johnny (real name John Lyon, from New Jersey) teamed up with the band The Asbury Jukes in the 1970's. Known as \"The World's Greatest Bar Band\", they still perform today."

The instruction card contained this typed text:Lighted \"Special When Lit\" Bumpers Award 1 Replay.Lighted \"Extra Special When Lit\" Holes and Rollovers Award 5 Replays.1 replay for 48,000.1 replay for 51,000.1 replay for every 1000 thereafter.According to the  Encyclopedia of Pinball Volume 2 page 230, this is the last game Gottlieb made with existing components prior to converting to 100% wartime work. We found a Billboard ad dated Feb-27-1943 page 126 where a distributor identified a Gottlieb 'Liberty' for sale as a revamp. The word 'revamp' seems to be used loosely by some distributors to mean either reconditioned (cleaned up but not converted) or converted so there may be no factual conflict here as to whether Gottlieb's 'Liberty' was an actual wartime conversion performed by Gottlieb. If it was, we do not know the source game used to convert it. Also, it is possible the distributor erroneously meant Sullivan-Nolan's 1942 'Liberty' which was a converted game.Compare this playfield with that of Gottlieb's 1945 'Stage Door Canteen', which was the first game Gottlieb made once they resumed pinball manufacturing."

The name \"Gottlieb\" is stamped on the coin door. The coin chutes are the protruding kind used by Gottlieb until Gottlieb's 1967 'Surf Side'. The pop bumper caps are the flattop style used by Gottlieb starting with 'Surf Side' although operators in Italy were known to substitute this newer flattop cap on games that had the older starburst ones. The metal card holder says \"Buttons\" without the word \"Flipper\" which usually means the game was meant for Italy. Two stationary targets score WOW when lit, just like add-a-ball games. There is an inlane feeding the left flipper but no right inlane. A third flipper is positioned at the top of the right outlane. The four drop targets are evenly spaced in mid-playfield, similar to Gottlieb's 1970 'Psychedelic'."

The text in the available ads continue this confusion. Interestingly, each ad or picture shows a game with subtle differences from the others, especially in placement and style of shooter knob. Because each ad also tends to identify one company over the others as manufacturer, a useful theory develops that these subtle differences between games actually indicate separate manufacturing.

We do not know what manufacturer in what country made either version, but the use of the 'S' runes is outlawed in Germany due to their use by Nazi organizations. We had wondered if it was even possible for a German manufacturer to have made the \"bolt-style\" playfield shown here. A hobbyist from Germany responded to tell us that early editions of record albums from the band KISS were available there with the \"bolt-style\" shape but were later changed to the rounded 'S'. This tells us that sales can occur, but it is difficult to speculate usefully until we know who manufactured each version.No information is available to us indicating there are two versions of the conversion backglass.We previously showed the manufacturer to be Geiger-Automatenbau.

They didn't think the software was ever finished because the CPU would lock up a lot. You plunged the ball and the ball rolled down to the sling that you controlled right and left with the buttons. Kind of like the video game Breakout in pinball form. You tried to sling the ball up the playfield to hit targets for points. (I don't know the shape or components contained in the sling. He said it had a rubber around it so I pictured in my mind a slingshot shape.) I distinctly remember him saying \"targets\". I don't know if the targets were at the top or placed around the middle. I don't know if it had pop bumpers. He said since the game never would work right, he trashed the playfield and boards and kept only the glass.

The ball plungers manually pivot to align shot with playfield arrows pointing toward scoring objectives. A single steel ball is shared by both players. A player is awarded only the points scored at the opposite end of the playfield. Pop bumpers are continuously lit and score the value indicated on the bumper caps. A stationary center post made of hard rubber deflects ball towards side slingshots. Each player has three hard rubber flippers individually operated by three table-top buttons. Ball landing in an outhole scores 1000 points for the far end player and is then served to the nearby ball plunger. There is no ball-in-play counter. Play continues until either player reaches a winning score of  20,000 points, then the bell rings about five times, all playfield lights flash, and the game goes to Game Over mode.Cabinet indicates 'AGAMCO, patent applied for'.There are two ball-in-channel tilt mechanisms to respond to either end of cabinet being raised during play. A player who lifts the cabinet and activates the corresponding tilt mechanism will cause a buzzer to sound, the game ends, and the opponent is made the winner.In May 2015 we were contacted by the manufacturer and given the following information:This machine was created, designed and built by Peter Unick. It was truly a family and friend business. Peter came up with the idea. His friend Don Suwinski worked right along side Pete with R&D. Don also built the cabinets along with Peter�s son Dean. Pete�s daughter Dae did the circuit boards. His daughter Dani assembled the machines. Approximately 100 made. The date was 1976 or 1977.The pinball scorer was solid state. I believe it was first in the industry. I have one that is still intact. The relays were used to activate the sounds, chimes and bell. I have no idea where \"sample\" originated [handwritten on the bell in one picture shown here]. It wasn�t our doing."

The playfield uses standup targets instead of drop targets and has no kick-out hole. The two games pictured here are from Italy. One has visible score reels as well as a small LED display on the backglass (above the woman's head) used for biri-biri. No manufacturer name was found anywhere on the game. The other game has a digital score display instead of score reels. No manufacturer name is evident in the pictures. Both games have front door hardware stamped 'Mondial' which suggests a conversion of Gottlieb. If so, it would appear  easier to have converted a 1-player game instead of 'Fire Queen' or Vulcan', to allow the reuse of the wedge head backbox, and to avoid reengineering the mechanisms from a multi-player operation. The two games shown here differ in their cabinet art. More information is needed to know if either artwork is original to this game or if they were made in separate production runs with separate manufacture dates.If anyone has access to either version of this game or to the manufacturer's documentation, please contact us. We seek pictures of inside of the backbox of each version. We also seek a close-up of the artist's signature on the backglass to clearly show the date."

Inside the cabinet, the playfield is surrounded by mirrors on three sides and is sloped towards the player. The slope is adjusted from under the playfield via a set screw and nut. Two large red bulbs above the playfield are lit during play.No flippers in the traditional sense, but each of the three springs that form the near edge of the playfield have kicker arms behind them that are attached to coils underneath the playfield. (In the example pictured here, each kicker arm is represented by two red 'fingers', but another example of this game uses a single yellow kicker arm.) Buttons on each side of the cabinet individually control the left and right coils. The player presses the buttons to propel the ball away from the left and right springs and back into the play area. The coil for the middle spring is activated automatically when the ball touches that spring and closes the circuit to the metal playfield, propelling the ball away.A center playfield spring bumper has a round disk at its top. The ball hitting the spring activates a coil which pulls down the disk, propelling the ball away like a pop bumper.The two targets in the upper corners each scores 10 points. The spring posts have light bulbs atop them. The green bulbs each scores 1 point when lit. The center spring bumper scores 1 point. During play the upper three green bulbs are lit. For every 10 points that are reached (by direct hit or by addition), the lower three green bulbs will light for approximately one second. If 5 points are reached (or 15, 25, ...) the two yellow bulbs will light to score 5 points. The yellow bulbs are lit only while the \"5\" is lit in the scoring panel.There is a buzzer for each 1-point scoring and a chime (like a door chime) for each 10-point scoring.A score of 100 can be recorded by a counter inside the game or a free game can be given. The free game can be started by pressing the front button under the coin chute.There is no outhole.

Initially, the name of the manufacturer was unknown to us and to the operator, Van der Meer, whom we had contacted at their website for more information. A senior staff member supplied this detailed reply:The pinball games are the only ones of their kind known in Holland. There are a few in private use, but the rest (36 and 2 in reserve) are in use in the fair by Van der Meer. They are made in Italy but they are sold in the Netherlands by Valco Automatenbouw in [the city of] Bergen op Zoom. They are about 35 years old [as of 2009].On the site you can see some changes of the machines, at this moment there are little LED's build in to make it more attractive. In winter time they will be painted again (outside).We don't know how many were built exactly. The machines work by Euro's (money), 1 ball 50 ct. or 5 for 2 euro coin. At every 300 points you will get a yellow coin and with these coins you can buy prizes; the more coins, the bigger the prize. When you play with one ball, 4000 points or more (=10 yellow coins) you get 40 coins extra. At every 300 points you will hear a funny sound and when the ball falls down (end of game) you will also hear a funny sound.Henk de Jeger, a collector in Holland, tells us about the manufacturer:\"I know the Valco company, owner was Mr. Leo Vale. The Vale family was very well-known in the coin machine business during the 70s and 80s. The brother of Mr. Leo Vale, Harry Vale, had been the official Bally distributor for the Netherlands some time in the 70s. Valco was a small company producing skill games for use on (travelling) fairs. The company's address was Zeelandhaven 12 at Bergen op Zoom (Netherlands). For many years, I didn't hear anything about that firm, so I checked out at the Chamber of Commerce and I found the company was liquidated in 2009.\""

A kicker then took the ball to a set of three lanes at the top of the playfield on the same side (there were two such sets of lanes).",

Stern participated in its creation and, according to someone at Stern, only one was made and all of the artwork was done by Bruce Quast, Exhibits Manager of the Discovery Center Museum in Rockford, Illinois, which exhibits the game.  Bruce did all the replacement artwork (playfield, plastics, cabinet, and translite) after Stern sent a blank, white cabinet and blank playfield to the museum.  After the art was completed by Bruce, it was sent for clear-coating and Stern assembled the final machine, including producing the custom playfield plastics.Stern also participated by removing all references to Simpsons from the programming and by changing the mini-display on the playfield to scroll \"BRAIN GAME\" continuously.  All sounds were replaced with simple electronic chime-like (i.e. classic electromechanical) noises.According to the same person at Stern, one addition is that the game will randomly go into a \"seizure\" where everything locks up for around 15 seconds.  A display effect was added for that occurrence, and a \"special game over ... that tells you to let the next person in line play.\"According to Chad Dentandt, who has played it: \"It uses [the] 5 senses. ... A journey through the mind. And about every 10-15 games it actually shuts down, for about 10 seconds, to represent a seizure.  An unwanted time out if you will.  People then can get somewhat of an idea of what it is like.\""

At that point in time (1985-86), RAVEN seemed to be the better product to hit the market with.  ACE HIGH was put back for one model's production run and was rescheduled to go after RAVEN.Well, once ramps were put on the game, there was no going back.  The next production game was Premier's 1986 'Hollywood Heat' and ACE HIGH was put on the shelf again.  It was never produced."

The second one has a cabinet serial number of AH 1595 but its playfield has a different serial number without leading alpha characters. This number, 1603, appears as though a six-digit stamp had been used with the first two digits dialed out of view before stamping, yet bottom portions of those two digits still appear, suggesting '12'.So far, these converted games have been located only in Europe and may have been intended for a specific country. While the 1969 Bally Parts Catalog lists alternate backglasses for certain other models that Bally shipped to Europe, 'Aces Top' is not listed. Perhaps this glass was made in Europe. We don't know how many 'Aces High' games had this converted glass or why it was done."

He comments on it:It's true. I wanted to vary the speed to make it progressively harder to make a shot. We got stuck with a single speed (FAST!) motor that met the cost criteria, but not the fun factor. We couldn't hit the lit target if our lives depended on it. The swinging target device that the first mechanical engineer designed was huge, expensive and complicated.  Being stuck with one speed was boring, so we dumped the whole idea. What we ended up with (a \"twitching\" GG) was weak and, although I asked him many times to improve it,the second engineer ended up giving us the mechanism that is Green Goblin. I asked Lyman [Sheats] to do multiple \"twitches\" instead of just one when a target was successfully hit. I think he managed it, in the end.MSRP when new: $5,799.00",

It was hand-built as a proposal to Stern to build a line of retro games. That arrangement did not happen, so Gottlieb was approached for a license to make this game. A prototype Gottlieb game complete with ticket vender and a brand new board system was hand-built for Gottlieb approval. Licensing was approved in 2009 and Retro Pinball LLC was formed to manufacture 100 numbered games and 200 regular models in Taiwan (all would have a white Gottlieb card holder and chrome trim). The first ten production games were produced and sold in 2010 but playfields carried a 2009 copyright as that is when parts production had begun. Production ended in 2012 after 5 sample production games and 50 regular production games were built. (The two hand-built prototypes are not included in our Production Run quantity of 55. The 5 sample production games were built individually and not in a factory setting by a group of people.) The 50 regular production games carried a numbered plaque (1 of 100, etc.) and only the first nine games off of the production line have a number that corresponds to its actual place in the production line. Beyond that, buyers were allowed to select from any remaining number in that range to be on their plaques, regardless of the actual place in production that each game occurred. Therefore, some of the 50 games produced may carry a plaque numbered between 51 and 100. Parts are in existence for an additional 50 games."

(IPB) declared plans to produce a \"remake\" of that 1996 game, initially announced to be a production of 101 machines but eventually increased to 183 units.  Despite reported substantial setbacks and cost overruns, in June 2006 approximately one dozen machines were delivered to European customers ahead of the RoHS (Reduction of Hazardous Substances) laws due to go into force in Europe in July 2006.  The remaining machines were completed and shipped in June 2007.The games were produced with the original \"Capcom\" name in numerous locations on the game and in documentation, and the game uses common Capcom circuit boards, but the still existing Capcom Co., Ltd. was not involved in its production.  Rather, IPB reportedly licensed the Capcom name along with the design.  A new company named \"Pinball Manufacturing Inc.\" was reportedly formed by IPB to manufacture and sell the machines.  So the manufacturer could be thought of as \"Pinball Manufacturing Inc., a division of Illinois Pinball Inc., doing business as Capcom\".Reportedly, the following differences exist in this remake as compared to the 1996 game:� The electroluminescent lights on the plastic ramp use 12v on this remake while on the original Capcom game they work on 24v.� The tube dancer is 13% smaller than the 1996 game - Gene Cunningham didn't have access to the original mold.� All remakes came with numbered plaques for the cardholder (whether or not they may be mounted there).At the 2010 Northwest Pinball and Gameroom Show, Gene Cunningham reported to us that additional units of this game were made using extra parts and playfields. These new machines carried serial numbers with the letters \"EXP\" for Extra Parts. He guessed the additional quantity was approximately 10 or 11 games although he was firm in stating the new total quantity is 191 units. Our previous quantity reported in this listing was ~183 units.",

Typically the tokens would be redeemed for drinks or cigarettes where the game was located, although after 1934 these games were against the law in France except in registered casinos, and so reportedly the regular bar owners did not want to have them.The art d�co paint on the cabinet and legs is typical of French games of the 1930's.There are two versions of this game pictured in this listing. Neither game offers any clues as to which one was made first. There are no patent numbers or copyright dates on either machine. One has a paper instruction card and the other has a more sophisticated playfield with a metal instruction card. Both have lockdown bars identified as reproductions. Although only one game shows the MAGISTER name on it, both games had the same tokens inside of them.The owner's research found only that a brand name MAGISTER was registered in Paris in 1928 by Louis Wolf, a phonograph manufacturer. No direct information about this game could be found.The owner reports having seen a version of this game at auction called 'Les R�gates' that has little boats instead of arrows."

Three versions of the backglass are shown here, none with words on them. They differ from each other in any of the following ways: placement of the digital display windows, border art, colors used, or the orientation of the entire image to show Perseus holding the sword in either hand. Almost all portrayals of Perseus in paintings, drawings, and sculpture show him holding his sword in his right hand, as does the constellation in the Northern Hemisphere that bears his name. In the movie poster, Perseus holds his sword in his right hand.The lower left and right playfield plastics show a Medusa with outstretched arms. The upper left plastic shows a sword-wielding Perseus and the upper right plastic shows Medusa's face with serpent's tongue. These four art elements are found in near-identical form on the backglass of Bally's 1981 'Medusa'.Reportedly, this is a kit made by J. Martina of France, and the Instruction card of one example we saw, written in French, had a number in the corner that began with the letters 'JM'. However, available information on J. Martina indicates this company was only active in EM conversions up to 1970. More information is needed to better identify the company that performed this post-1984 SS conversion.The company who made this game likely also made Unknown Manufacturer's 'Commandos'."

Nine steel balls were found in this game. The correct quantity of balls is not confirmed, but to meet or beat 40,000 points, seven out of the nine balls would each have to score the highest value of 5000 points.The RECORD feature was described by the owner as a high point indicator having a slide to change the center color.The cat emblem is likely meant to be Felix the Cat, a cartoon character popular in the 1920's.

Two other distributors, Budco and one other, advertised a 'Click' on April 25, 1942. None of these ads have pictures, and none mention Stoner in them.However, in a Billboard ad dated February 14, 1942,  K.C. Novelty Company listed a �Stoner Click� among its used games for sale. Interestingly, they considered this game �used� by this time,  while only two weeks earlier in the same magazine it seemed to have its first ad from National Novelty.Stoner is believed to have closed its doors in 1941, and their last games for which there is documentation were produced beginning in August of that year. �Click� appears to be among their last pinball games before closing down, and this could account for the dearth of advertising evidence for it."

The maximum score that can be displayed is 199,990 points. Other lamps for higher scores (200,000, 300,000, etc.) are not used. In this mode, WOWs award an add-a-ball then reset. The maximum Balls To Play is 9. A design error exists in this mode that allows a player to insert a second coin just before shooting the first ball in play, and this adds additional balls to play.In novelty mode, the 100,000 relay is not used. Instead, the add-a-ball unit is used to step through the backglass bulb scoring, lighting from 100,000 to 900,000 and from 1,000,000 to 9,000,000. WOWs score 50,000 points each time when hit and do not reset until end of ball in play. The maximum score that can be displayed in this mode is 9,999,990 points.Although the backglass is silkscreened for up to 10 balls to play, it can count up to only 9 (in add-a-ball mode) because the \"10\" has no lamp or insert hole behind it.",

He tells us some of what it took to make it happen:The speech was the typical editing of \"lifted\" movie sound track speech with a lot of custom speech. Each of the \"sound-alike\" voice actors had to be personally approved by the major actors, according to the contracts Eddie Murphy, Mike Myers, and the rest have with DreamWorks. That led to quite an 11th-hour deadline nightmare for Gary [Stern]. Another huge nightmare was in nailing down the licensing of Smash Mouth's \"All Star\" for the opening music of the game. I recorded an instrumental version of the tune with Dan Peters, a guitarist Chris Granner introduced me to years ago. We also found a singer who was able to piece together for us a reasonable vocal knockoff (Smash Mouth's Steve Harwell is a rather unusual sounding vocalist). Well, Smash Mouth said they would not allow anything but the original recording to go into the game. Of course that meant bigger bucks. I have no information as to what Gary paid, but ultimately the original recording starts the game and runs through the first chorus (\"Hey now, you're an All Star...\"). From that point, it's my instrumental version during the remainder of the general mainplay. The rest of the music is all lifted straight from the three Shrek movie soundtracks. But let me tell you, it is not an easy feat trying to make seamless loops out of orchestral music that's not composed for a coin-op game. It's quite beautiful, though. And, thankfully, we had the room to put in all those long loops, as this game has no foreign speech. Overall, what was supposed to have been a 2-month job converting the game sound from Family Guy over to Shrek took closer to four months.MSRP when new: $5,699.00"

In contrast, the Coin Machine Journal ad, shown here and sponsored by Evans, shows a picture of the other game as the \"Club\" model. More information is needed to resolve this apparent conflict as to which version Evans really designated as the Club model.We list below a few obvious physical differences between the two cabinet versions, based on our current images, avoiding for now the \"Club\" reference for either cabinet. Version 1 - \"the white-trimmed backglass\"1) Backglass has white horses, stars, horseshoes, 'Evans' lettering, and circle outlines. Actual trim may not be white like they show in our black-and-white images but we have no photographs of this version with which to verify.2) Horses on front of cabinet are racing to the left.3) Coin slot is located at top of coin door on front of cabinet and has a large round escutcheon.Version 2 - \"the mirror-trimmed backglass\"1) Backglass has mirrored effect in the horses, stars, horseshoes, 'Evans' lettering, and circle outlines. In black-and-white images, this looks like dark trim.2) Horses on front of cabinet are racing to the right.3) Coin slot is located on the lockdown bar next to the large round Start button.

No 3-ball option, the 5th played ball pushes a switch to end the game.There is no replay mechanism, add-a-ball mechanism, replay adjustment plugs, or knocker on this game. Therefore, the \"1-2-3 Partidas\" on the backglass appears to be only for crediting up to three coined games. This function might be more attractive to the player if the game was intended to allow discounted pricing such as \"1 coin 1 play, 2 coins 3 plays\". However, the owner of the game in the images attributed to 'Manzaneque' stated there are no option plugs to change the price. This mechanism was broken on that game and only sometimes does it step to \"2\" after the insertion of a second peseta. If it performed consistently, its apparent purpose might be confirmed.The manufacturer plate for that game (pictured here) shows that 85970 is the seal number from the Ministry of Industry.

No 3-ball option, the 5th played ball pushes a switch to end the game.There is no replay mechanism, add-a-ball mechanism, replay adjustment plugs, or knocker on this game. Therefore, the \"1-2-3 Partidas\" on the backglass appears to be only for crediting up to three coined games. This function might be more attractive to the player if the game was intended to allow discounted pricing such as \"1 coin 1 play, 2 coins 3 plays\". However, the owner states there are no option plugs to change the price. This mechanism is broken on this game and only sometimes does it step to \"2\" after the insertion of a second peseta. If it performed consistently, its apparent purpose might be confirmed.The manufacturer plate shows that 83351 is the seal number from the Ministry of Industry.

They advertise that the games were shipped \"F.O.B. Chicago\". The term \"Free On Board Chicago\" does not specify if Chicago was the starting point or a destination point for these games. If it was a starting point, then Automatic Amusement Company was likely just a distributor for this game or perhaps was private label for an (unknown) manufacturer located in Chicago. If Chicago was a destination point to where shipping charges were paid by this company, then this suggests that they were aware of an intense competition for sales to the Chicago area.We think they were a distributor or reseller in light of their advertising flyer for Bally's 1935 'Jumbo'. If true, it would follow that 'Lone Star' was made in the Chicago area."

And there is another on the LH side, above the drop target bank.  One stand-up target in the center and three more in the upper LH area (still on the main playfield). There is a kick-out hole at the LH rear of the main playfield too (where all the lights are).  There is also a flipper in that area (RH flipper).  When the ball was captured here, a large gate would swing in front of this area (from the left side) and make the same playfield shot (from the bottom flippers) now go to a ball kicker on the LH side (which shot the ball back up to the top playfield).  You can see the \"nose\" of this gate sticking out from under a painted area of the plastics, just above and left of two lit orange inserts. There is another kick-out hole to the left of the main flippers which also could have been fed by a pinball \"catch\" and reverse flow up the LH return lane.  I believe it kicked the ball back to the RH slingshot area."

The layout really cuts the board in half.  Tough to get nice ball flow.  But the bottom area was pretty interesting to play.  Fast too.Two-ball multi-ball would have been good for this layout.  As the captured ball is hidden, it should have been brought back into play when the second ball hit the scoring playfield from the plunger. But now, the more I look at it,  there is a purple colored insert in front of the LH area in question.  That color was restricted to the \"Extra Ball\" targets and the \"Shoot Again\" at Gottlieb.  I think that perhaps the LH shot was only a stand-up target and the RH shot was a kick-back capture area (with an orange colored insert)."

I think I was going in the right direction with the layout, but the rules were again not very familiar to most players.The playfield above the pop bumpers was a set (2 pieces) of clear flat plastic ball guides supported by split posts.  The ball traveled from the ramp tube exit, around the top right-hand pop, through the center of the bumper nesting and finally around the bottom left-hand pop and back down on to the main playfield.  You can see it best (?) at the exit from the upper level just before the rollunder switch.  The pinball is actually on this upper level for the photo."

		"notes": "An unknown (small) quantity of Gottlieb's 1979 'The Incredible Hulk' (Model #433) games were experimentally built with the then-new Gottlieb System 80 MPU platform and called Model #500. This new platform provided more functionality, allowing for more solenoids, lamps, and switches. Model #500 had attract lighting, a strobing High Score To Date, and a third coin slot. Reportedly, there are four known examples held by collectors.We do not know if these prototype Hulks are included in the Model #433 Production Run quantity of 6,150 units.The first of two games pictured here has Sample serial number 01447 S. This number is stamped in the wood of the cabinet just above the shooter gauge and also appears on stickers affixed to the power supply and driver boards. On the top of the backbox, this number has been \"over-stamped\" in ink, as 00447 and as 01447, without the 'S'. Probably 00447 was stamped first, in error, and had to be corrected. The inside of the backbox appears to be a standard System 1 backbox. The power supply is mounted on metal \"standoffs\" that connect it electrically to the backbox grounding. The prototype Driver Board pictured has a sticker in the upper right corner with \"SYS II\" hand written on it. Diagnostics via the coin door test switch are identical to later System 80 diagnostics. Some of its circuit boards pictured here are known to be replacements and are not original. We have marked them as such and included them, in case questions arose about them, and until such time that pictures of original boards are received by us. The second game has Sample serial number 01443 S stamped just above the shooter gauge while the top of the backbox is ink-stamped 01443, no �S�. The game was at auction so we were unable to obtain specific images of inside the backbox to compare with the first Sample game.See the Files Section of this listing for a transcript of an email discussion of Model #500 which includes references to some of the pictures shown here.Pictured in this listing are three images of a backglass presented to us as a prototype having no gray paint masking on the reverse side thus it doesn't have the silkscreened words such as \"High Score to Date\", \"Game Over\", and \"Tilt\". This glass appears to be mounted in a backbox but we were unable to verify whether or not this glass came from the factory mounted in a game and, if so, if its MPU is System 1 or System 80 to know if it belongs in this listing as Model 500. Without more information available to us, we have marked these backglass images as Alternate Artwork and we show close-ups of two areas where the colors were indeed different than the production backglasses."

Other pinball resources did the same, likely because that is the name the manufacturer seemed to always use in their many advertisements of this game. Distributors, however, would list this game as \"Marines At Play\", if they had sufficient ad space, because that is the longer name shown on the backglass. We now show that longer name for this listing in anticipation of what today�s hobbyists will see when they look at the backglass.In Billboard, beginning with the ad dated Sep-30-1944 page 81, Westerhaus advertised this game as having a \"revised playfield\" but did not elaborate on that, nor did they specify if the Free Ball feature and the Jackpot feature, also mentioned in that ad, was part of the revision. At least we understand from this ad that there was a playfield design change during production of this 1944 game.A separate, second production run was announced the following year. See Westerhaus Manufacturing Co.'s 1945 'Marines At Play (2nd Edition)'.The pictures shown here are all from one machine. Its playfield does not have the features advertised for the 2nd Edition. We don't know if it represents the original 1st Edition or the revised 1st Edition."

One of the copycat games was Genco's 1932 'Jiggers (Jr)' and another was Ace Novelty's 1932 'Who's Goofy'. Ace Novelty then cleverly escaped Bally's injunction by stopping their copycat game \"Who's Goofy\" and instead started making Ace Novelty's 1933 'Jiggilo', a copy of the Jiggers game. Thus, Ace was now making a copy of a copy, and was no longer directly copying the Bally game.Based on this information, it's possible that this December 1932 conversion kit was Ace's initial response to the injunction, to address their \"Who's Goofy\" games that they had sold prior to the injunction, while they soon ramped up to a full production game, Ace Novelty's 1933 'Jiggilo'."

Likely this classifies as a 1-player game with suggestive selling in the ad.This game may be listed as a pinball machine in other resources while we offer the following assessment.We are not sure how this game shoots the balls, or even if there is really just one ball recycled ten times. A gauged plunger, expected of a pinball machine, is not obvious in the advertisement in this listing. The pull knob is apparently only for resetting the pins in whatever manner this occurs. To the right of this knob may be what is a small push-button which suggests an electric operation, perhaps a ball shooter. Or, maybe it is merely a keyhole for accessing the cashbox in a way not evident in this drawing. The knob on the far right front has great vertical travel, and may be a ball lift mechanism and/or a way of aiming the ball towards the desired pins to knock down.Although the lower playfield is out of view in the advertisement, it seems that points are not scored by balls landing in score pockets, but instead bowling pins are knocked down with points tallied visually and recorded by the player(s) on the score sheet provided. To simulate bowling, the knob would be pulled to reset the pins after each frame.This game looks really like a small arcade bowling machine and not an unusual flipperless pinball machine, thus we classify it as not a pinball and show it here for informational purposes."

He added a system of recycling the balls by drilling holes in the playfield along with adding a shuttle (a.k.a. baffle) underneath so that balls falling into these score holes would stay trapped there for the rest of the game play. He added a knob on the front of the game allowing the player to push the shuttle at start of next game to allow the trapped balls to fall through and roll down to an area where he added a ball-lift knob allowing the player to serve the balls into play.Ten games were made in approximately 30 days. The first one had a handmade coin chute which was replaced by a new Monarch/A.B.T. coin chute for the remaining nine.They continued making improvements to this game, and after changing their company name, they hit upon the game that enjoyed an overwhelming success, Automatic Industries, Incorporated's 1931 'Whiffle Board', which naturally caught the attention of the existing coin machine industry, thus accelerating the development of a highly competitive pinball machine industry."

This knob was dropped from production of Whiffle after the 15th game. The patent failed, and one can infer from reading the Encyclopedia of Pinball Volume 1 that the failure was tied to this center shuttle, but the actual reason is not specifically stated there. The patent application was continued under new number 1,938,495 showing the playfield for Whiffle Board Deluxe and incorporated all the changes made up to this point, including:1) the Deluxe playfield2) supplier-produced Monarch coin slide3) improved ball shooter4) ball-lift knobbut this time it did not include the center shuttle knob.This new application was granted.Patent #1,938,495 [GAME APPARATUS] filed January 19, 1932.

Paulin for his young daughter, Lois, after encountering an old bagatelle while cleaning out his barn. According to the Encyclopedia of Pinball Vol 1, because Lois and her friends enjoyed it so much, he later took it to the local drugstore, run by a druggist named Myrl A. Park, where a customer and salesman Earl W. Froom dropped in to buy cigars. Froom was very interested in it and, after Park suggested adding a coin device to it, offered to check into it further. From this, a three-way partnership was born which in January 1931 led to the addition of a fourth partner, bookkeeper William B. Howell, as together they created Yohio Manufacturing Company and set out to manufacture coin-op versions of this game.For the next part of this story, see Yohio Mfg.'s 1931 'Old Jenny (Whiffle)'.The Encyclopedia of Pinball Volumes 1 and 2 both state that the Whiffle playfield layout was copied from the British Corinthian bagatelle games (an example would be Witzig's 'Corinthian 15'). This could suggest that the game Paulin found in his barn was a Corinthian."

It has bulb-illuminated Player Count and Ball In Play indicators and a replay window sized for a replay wheel, while the score displays are the narrow size typical of digital displays. Some European EM games have digital displays therefore we cannot conclude from this backglass if this game is relay-controlled or solid state. The artwork has a female warrior and a volcano similar to the backglass of Gottlieb's 1977 'Jungle Queen'. No copyright date is evident in the image."

Inside the coin box compartment is a half-peeled sticker still bearing the penciled date of 4-1-35, presumably the date of final manufacture. The batteries in the game were replaced with a transformer at some point in time.We might have assumed this hand-painted playfield was another unfortunate after-factory obliteration of original art if it were not for an article in The Coin Machine Journal of March 1936 telling of an experiment conducted by the manufacturer to increase operator profit. A.B.T. held a prize contest for the artist who could paint the most beautiful playfields using several of their games. It would make sense that the manufacturer would have supplied unpainted playfields for this contest, so it would follow that these playfields are not 'repaints'. One of the two contest entries that are pictured in the article, A.B.T.'s 1936 'Four Roses', has the same design layout as this 'Four Crowns' playfield so they must have been contest entries based on the same game. We don�t know if 'Four Crowns' won any prizes for its artist, but it appears to be a contest entry that has survived the years."

The game was called 'Pickwick' of which there were a number of models. This listing is for the Gamages model.Gamages was a cut-price emporium located on Holborn Road in London from 1878 to 1972.

Distributors advertised this game in their showrooms starting August 10th. Then in October of the same year, the firm changed its name again, to Firestone Enterprises Inc. They had been leasing their manufacturing location at 1604 Chestnut and had added 10,000 sf to their existing 20,000 sf, while they were also in motion to purchase the building.The first Billboard ad from the manufacturer for this rolldown game is dated 07/06/1946 p161 and shows a picture of 'Tally Roll' already manufactured. Interestingly, it also shows a teaser image of a pinball machine they stated was still on their test bench. We reviewed their ads at least through early December but never saw another mention of a pinball machine. Further Billboard searching seems to only indicate this company in 1947 made coin-operated radios. We see no Billboard activity from this manufacturer after September, 1947."

Cabinet advertised as 92cm by 50cm by 91cm.This is a head-to-head game where two players at opposite ends of the playfield compete in simultaneous play. Each player has flipper buttons which control only those flippers facing the opponent.",
		"notes": "We have found several versions of this flipper game, evidencing at least four different playfields and two different table top designs, with varying cabinet details between them. There are probably more versions to discover. We have found no connection to the literary \"James Bond 007\" in any of them.One of the two versions pictured here carries a plate  designating it Model 502 with serial number 3305. It has a two-color playfield (half-green and half-yellow-green) with two posts and four flippers. Four inserts, two green and two red, briefly light simultaneously at the start and end of each game, accompanied by a buzzing sound. For each player, the flippers activate simultaneously by pressing either left or right flipper button, and this allows the player�s other hand to operate the large swivel handle that controls the goalie (aka the \"Torkanone\"), moving it back and forth to defensively block the opponent�s ball. Pressing the red button on the handle makes the goalie kick the ball towards the opponent as an offensive maneuver. Two posts  are placed at the center line, but close to each side wall, to stay out of the way of most of the power shots. The playfield has several decals depicting women in various clothing unrelated to sports, but these decals were actually part of the intended product as evidenced by their appearance on the game in the distributor�s flyer. (It may have been the distributor�s idea to add the decals, and we have no manufacturer flyer with which to compare.) The game owner advised us that game play lasts about 100 seconds, and that the ball weighs 10g and has a diameter of 2.48 cm. This game is the only example we found that has metal plates surrounding the flipper buttons. The owner removed the plates and found that one side of the cabinet had an extra hole for each player, the size of a flipper button. If the holes were an error of manufacture or indicative of a prototype design or other experimentation, the plates presumably were added to cover them and make this cabinet useful. The table top area containing the score counters is a solid red color. The distributor, Autronic Handels GmbH, advertised itself on this game more prominently than did the manufacturer, on a large adhesive sticker above the cabinet hinge, and on the paper instruction cards inserted at each end of the table top, where they inexplicably referred to this game as \"007 TORFLIPPER\", an appellation found nowhere else in our research.According to a history webpage we found (no longer online, but we found another webpage), VEB Luckenwalde Metallwarenfabrik (Lumet) was created in either 1951 or 1952 as a result of a series of post-WWII reorganizations of metalworking factories in Germany. It was a publicly-owned company (Volkseigener Betriebe, or VEB) in East Germany that made, among other things, air pumps, gas lighters, and \"the first automatic vending machines\", although German initiative with vending machines goes back much further. Online we have found Lumet patents from 1959-60 for coin-operated vending machines. A Billboard article shown here and dated March 20, 1961 page 118 announced their entry into the production of pinball machines.Lumet also made arcade games that used the same cabinets as shown here. Examples of these arcade games are \"Toto-Fix\" (football, or American soccer) and \"Eishockey\" (ice hockey), where there are movable \"manikins\" on the playfield, controlled by each player. The pinball cabinets shown here have an unused round metal fitting at each end where the protruding manikin controls were not needed. We have read of these arcade games having manufacture dates in the late 1950s (dates unconfirmed by us) and from this we speculate that it was economical for Lumet in 1961 to simply adapt their arcade cabinets for pinball use.The other version pictured here has a single-color yellowish playfield, four flippers, and six posts. The table top area is red with no instruction cards. It has the swiveling goalie at each end so we presume that pressing either flipper button activates both flippers simultaneously. The playfield has no picture decals, a detail that sets it apart, and with its six posts placed in such a way as if to thwart many offensive power shots, we wonder if this game had an after-factory playfield swap from a Toto-Fix arcade game, one model of which used the same plain yellow playfield. The posts may have filled the holes vacated by the manikins.We note that the games pictured here operate on 10 pfennig per play. We show a flyer produced by the distributor indicating play is 20 pfennig. Its black-and-white picture shows a game with a two-color playfield having eight dark-colored flippers and no external Torkanone control handle. In fact, a large metal plate has been placed over the areas where the control handle and unneeded arcade fitting would have been. The object that is visible between the flippers likely is a stationary post. The glass table top has a diamond-net pattern that the other games do not have. A date for this flyer was given to us unconfirmed as 1966.  If that date is true, it could support an evolutionary timeline as suggested by the game it displays and the higher price to play it. We caution, however, that we have no confirmed dates for any of the versions in this listing.Another version we have seen (not shown here) has a half-green, half-gold playfield, four dark red flippers, four inserts, two posts, and decals. Its diamond-net table top has instruction cards. Each player has the movable goalie and external handle but the cabinet does not have the residual round arcade fitting.Here is the flyer translation:2-Player-Competition-Flipper007 Finally something new! � Pricing 0,20 DM (20 Pfennig) � Automatic Ball-Lift� Test-Samples left a fascinated crowd of players and satisfied operators.� 007 is the only 2-Player-Competition-Flipper of our time who indicates and proves the real skills of both players.� Playing this machine shows always new surprises.

His explanation indicates neither a DOM or S/N is shown there, as he believes this is what the plate says:22-9-67 is the date for the approval of operation of this machine.26-6-1971 is the last date the machine was inspected by the governing authority. Probably, they later changed the law and such inspections weren't reflected on the machine.7193 is the number of machine inspected, in order, probably for that year. Those inspections weren't only made for pinballs, so 7100, for instance, could be another completely different machine than a pinball. B32807 probably is the reference of the administrative dossier.He, and we, invite corrections to this explanation."

Magic Match feature: Player can spot M-A-G-I-C (in any sequence) by collecting 50 points value of \"Merlin's Secret\" hole: each 50-points value indicator is linked with one letter of M-A-G-I-C.

This is because pushing the button on the jackpot mechanism pushes a rod inside the game. The addition of the ball in this sequence provides the additional extension needed for this rod to make contact with another button under the playfield to release all of the jackpot coins to the payout cup. When the button is released, the ball is returned to the player to shoot again, although at this point there is no jackpot to win.The cabinet appears to be made of mahogany or cherry wood. The trim around the top edges framing the playfield are not original as they were added by a previous owner.",
		"notes": "This game is missing the panel that covers the lower part of the playfield where the ball serve alley and payout mechanism are now visible. An instruction card likely would have been on this panel to identify the name of this game. Without instructions, the significance of the red steel ball is unclear when any ball in play can score the jackpot.The cabinet has slots where legs would insert. The legs may have been joined in pairs for sturdiness. The metal box underneath allows for a cashbox to slide in and be locked into place. We make note of one image of the cabinet side that may help with identification of this game or its manufacturer. It shows a diamond-shaped area of the wood where an applique had once been attached. There are five small nail holes, one at each point of the diamond and one at its center.The shipping notice found inside the cabinet was a Railroad Express Agency (REA) shipping label sending the game to New London, Wisconsin. The name of the exact recipient and the name and address of the sender are no longer legible. Other than this notice and the serial number, there are no other numbers or patent numbers on the cabinet.The Profit Sharer was an attachment offered for sale to operators and jobbers to allow a non-payout game to be converted to a payout game. It was also advertised to principal manufacturers for new games. Therefore, its presence on a game does not determine who made the game or if the game was originally produced with this device."

The instruction and score cards that were with this game were copies obtained from someone who owned the replay version  therefore they were removed from the game before pictures were taken.The owner of this game reports additional information about it:I cannot confirm [if only one added ball earned per ball in play] because the AAB feature on my machine is not working correctly. Meaning when I set the AAB feature on the AAB light lite always stays lit and the game will stay on ball 1 'forever'. Please note: this machine has a match feature as you can see the 0123456789 on the backglass. There is a jack in the machine as well to turn the match on or off. I cannot confirm if the match feature actually works on the AAB model because even when the match feature is on, the machine never matches. The credit unit does not function and I'm not sure if it was ever meant to. It is all wired up and there was factory grease on the stepper.

A spring loaded lever shoots the ball up where it bounces around various nails and ends up in slots at the bottom that have different values.  There are some holes in the playfield at the slot areas where it may have been planned to add some contacts and then behind the painted circles at the top of the glass there may have been some plan to add lights for scoring.  There is no wiring, or even evidence that anything was ever wired.  The back of the playfield has some small pinholes that look like places to add a screw to hold wiring or something, but it does not appear that any of these small pinholes have ever had a screw in them.As stated above, the inside of the cabinet has no electrical mechanisms to fill the air space, and the playfield backside shows many large holes at top and bottom where light bulbs would protrude for illumination. An operator instruction card was stapled to the middle of this backside. One game shown here does have that card still attached, but it discusses Genco's 1946 'Whizz', a game that does have a large internal electromechanical mechanism, and has payout. Curiously, there seems to be no similar place inside the Whizz cabinet to attach the instruction card for it."

The patent text does not specify an exact means of powering the rotating disc. This particular game is powered by a General Electric A.C. phonograph motor. The motor has an adjustable speed control.

This artwork is a reverse image of the backglass on Europlay's 'Fast Draw'.Same playfield layout as Gottlieb's 1975 'Fast Draw' but because the cabinet is wider than Gottlieb's cabinet, the playfield has a wide plastic border on each side to compensate.This game may be a conversion kit, but we are having trouble obtaining conclusive information about it. If a kit, the pictures we show here might have been a cabinet for Gottlieb's 1981 'Volcano' with the double flipper buttons. The Instruction Card has a number in the corner that begins with the letters 'JM'. The relevance of this is suggested somewhat in the listing for Unknown Manufacturer's 'Mythology', another game likely made by the same manufacturer. Both games have the same cabinet artwork."

The Vale family was very well-known in the coin machine business during the 70s and 80s. The brother of Mr. Leo Vale, Harry Vale, had been the official Bally distributor for the Netherlands some time in the 70s. Valco was a small company producing skill games for use on (travelling) fairs. The company's address was  Zeelandhaven 12 at Bergen op Zoom (Netherlands). For many years, I didn't hear anything about that firm, so I checked out at the Chamber of Commerce and I found the company was liquidated in 2009, last known address was Plantagelaan 12, Hoogerheide, Netherlands. (Postal code: 4631 CS).\"About the \"Soccer Champ\" machine: I've never seen one, but I found it on a list of allowed skill games for fairgrounds from the Belgian government. The allowance was dated: 01-01-2000. As I said, this kind of machine was for use at fairs. The machines had no legs. Ten, twelve, or more of them were put on a long, circular table at the right height to play. The game is simple: put a coin in (mostly 50 eurocent) and you can play for 30 seconds (adjustable). The ball cannot leave the playfield. Hit as many goals as possible during the playing time. Each goal is added on the display. When player reach a certain (adjustable) score, he earns one token, immediately paid out by the machine. It is possible to earn more than one token during a game. After 30 seconds (adjustable) the flippers are switched off, and the game ends. The player can change the tokens by the stand-owner for small prizes, or try (game after game) to earn more tokens for bigger prizes. Prizes differ between a piece of candy for one token, and a large 3-foot tall teddy-bear for 200 or more tokens.\"Henk also translated the flyer text for us:Mini-pinball \"Soccer Champ\"The pinball machine exclusively designed for fairgrounds.- A pure game of skill, so no discussion about legal allowance.- Very popular by youth and older people as well, no game explanation needed.- Automatic token distribution, so no extra employees needed.- Electronic, adjustable coin system.- Adjusted playing time is displayed in backglass.- Nice sounds and light effects. Game rules: - After inserting a coin there is 30 seconds of playtime as indicated on backglass.- During playtime player must hit as many targets as possible, by using the both flippers.- The 4 targets scores 1 point each at the score display.- Hitting the \"soccer goal\" scores 1 to 3 points, depending on the power of the shot.- A score of 8 points rewards one token, paid out automatically by machine.  - At higher scores, more tokens can be won, tokens can be exchanged for prizes. - Compact dimensions:Front height:   33 cm.   (13 inches)Backbox height: 74 cm.   (29 1/8 inches)Length:         87 cm    (34 1/4 inches)Width:          45 cm    (17 3/4 inches)"

However, to resolve a royalty disparity between the two manufacturers, Williams changed the name of this Exhibit game to 'Lightning'. The EOP does not pinpoint whether production began before or after the name was changed, and this allows for the possibility that there could have been some of these 1934 'Contact' games made by Exhibit. If that is true, it could explain any otherwise unaccountable variations in design or style for 'Contact' games identified as made by PAMCO. 'Lightning' is the first pin table made by Exhibit, and their first EM game. Exhibit made two sizes, 18 x 36 inches, and 22 by 44 inches. For easy identification, pinball literature will include the cabinet length after the name. Our website adds the designation \"First Style\" as well. The playfield layout was the same as 'Contact'. This became problematic from a marketing standpoint, so Harry Williams redesigned 'Lightning' to have a new and different upper playfield than 'Contact', colored red, and a different cabinet. This redesigned game is known as Exhibit's 1934 'Lightning 44 (New Style)'."

The playfield has gates that open. Score reel scoring.There is no outhole. The ball sits on the flipper springs when the game is over.Extra balls and replays are awarded.",
		"notes": "No date was evident on this game. Circa 1971.We asked Martin Wiest if the ball rests on the springs (flippers) during game play, as suggested by one of his pictures, or only at Game Over. In his reply, he explains the type of skill required for these flippers:Yes, the ball rests on the spring during gameplay and is shot by the kicker when you press the button, and the kicker hits the spring so you can wait once the ball is rolling on the spring, and push the button when you think the ball is in position - the shooting angle depends how far the ball is away from the point where the spring is hit by the kicker.If the ball rests too early or in a wrong position, then flip only very short, as this kicks soft and makes the ball roll only on the spring.The ball drains when it hits the spring and rolls aside too quickly and you miss to hit the button to catapult it again.Sometimes when the ball comes down, it just bounces and comes to rest quickly - the horizontal motion it gets is different every time - and sometimes you can wait until it rolls/bounces in position. Other times, it moves quickly and you have to flip to prevent it from draining.Last but not least, when it moves horizontally with bouncing in the right position, it might enter the jackpot lane on the left, one inch above spring level. The jackpot needs to be enabled to be awarded."

The instructions state that, before inserting coin, player must push button on top of game to reset the tilt if needed and to clear the previous score, which could only mean removing from the playfield any coins left in the score pockets from the previous game. Reportedly, these played coins would then drop into a cash can corresponding to the pocket hit, and coins that did not score would drop to the bottom of the game. This suggests that winning scores at game's end could be reported to the location for payout before the button is pushed, and the owner of the machine could later count the segregated coins to reimburse the location.",

No balls are used. The same article refers to this machine as a pin game. While the term \"pin game\" is not untrue for a game having pins on its playfield, as this one has, this term more often denotes the use of round pinballs and not just pins. Because 'Hi Fly' does not use pinballs, we classify it as Not A Pinball and maintain this listing to clarify and expand the Billboard article."

He replied:The prototype SS version of Grand Prix should be May, 1977 which is when we put out the very first of these. As for how many, as far as I remember, we only built 5 of these back then. Each member of the original design team received one after we brought these back from test.Ken Fedesna later confirmed the quantity of 5 units was accurate, not approximate.The MPU used in these prototypes is sometimes referred to as \"System 1\". It was only used for this game.What is sometimes called \"System 2\" is only used in a few prototypes as Williams' 1976 'Aztec'. \"System 3\" was the first system used for regular production.Compare the playfield with Williams' 1977 'Liberty Bell'."

The side rollovers also step the wheels. Only when the bottom red pop bumper is lit do both number wheels light up for 10 times their indicated bonus value. Each number wheel is scored by hitting the standup target in front of it. The bonus point values of each wheel are as follows: 20,10,30,40,20,30,10,20,10, and star. The star does not give any points but lights the extra ball indicator on the lower playfield whether the wheel is lit or not. There is no extra ball indicator on the backglass. The green and red rollover buttons turn the yellow pop bumper on and off. It is their only function, even though they are inexplicably marked 'Pop Red Bumpers'.

The cash box is missing but a hasp that was probably used to secure it can be seen on the bottom board.Interesting comments from a collector who had access to this game:The mechanical parts of this game operate as smoothly as a Swiss watch. It just has that precision feel to it. The coin mechanism never jams. You push in that reset bar and it sounds and feels like a scientific instrument. When the balls hit the score reels, they just flip over silently and never stick. Then there's the cabinet. Look at that hack job under the coin slot. Even the top of the side rail, below the coin plate, is not cut well. Obviously, the donor game had a much different type of coining. I did not photograph it, but under the instruction card is a long open area in the wood, there for no obvious reason. Again, probably something to do with the original game."

One picture shows that the operator was provided a choice of equipping the game with EM chimes or with a System-1 soundboard with speaker to provide electronic sound. Reportedly, either option was at extra cost to the operator. We know this option was provided for other Gottlieb games of this time period and may have been restricted to their export games. We do not have similar pictures of Gottlieb non-export games to help us determine if this choice of sound system existed in export games only. See Gottlieb's 1978 'Close Encounters of the Third Kind' for another such picture on a game exported to France.Inexplicably, the coin entrance housing on this game is branded by Electro-Matic, a Brazilian firm that made their own pinball games. Very little information has been confirmed about them or about Fipermatic, or of any cooperative relationship between the two companies.

According to the Encyclopedia of Pinball Volume 1, Durant introduced the game in May, for which partner George Campbell had provided the funding, and the intent was to sell the idea to a large manufacturer in Chicago then split the royalties. This was unsuccessful, so they decided to make the game themselves, in Agawam, as C.& D. Manufacturing Company. Their ads indicate production took place by June 1933, so that is the date we list, as it seems likely that the game Durant brought to Chicago in May was a prototype. The name of this manufacturer was derived from the last names of the owners, George H. Campbell and Lyndon A. Durant.In October 1933 the company made an improved version of this game, adding a second totalizer, and changing the company name around this same time. See Lone Eagle Mfg. Co.'s 1933 'Lone Eagle'. Three years later, Durant�s invention would finally make it to Chicago, as an electrified version used on Shyvers (Chicago)'s 1936 'Round 'n' Round', for which he would share in the credit."

Above this window is the word 'Monte' and below it is the word 'Carlo'. On the left side of the glass is a round window painted 'Start' and on the right side is a round window painted 'Finish'. Both round windows light from within.The flipperless playfield is polished metal and has spring bumpers. The lower apron is two-tone wood, alternating light and dark in a radiating pattern. The front of the cabinet has no coin door or other opening, and no place to insert coins. It does have a metal ball lift knob and metal ball shooter. A coin drop may be located on the cabinet side, but no side view images were made available to us to confirm this. These images did not allow us to determine if this game was made with legs.Included with the game were three paper chits or tickets, each printed with these words:Billard ElectriqueMONTE CARLOBon pour 1 LOTThe ticket could be redeemed for a choice of prizes of a certain value, or redeemed in quantity for a prize of higher value.We have seen modified examples where two bottom spring bumpers were replaced with short white Gottlieb-style flippers and, in one instance of this, the cabinet was encased in black and turquoise plastic. All examples of this game that we have seen were located in France.Compare this game to Unknown Manufacturer's 'Monte Carlo (Cylinder Backbox Model)'."

Base on the pictures shown here, we thought those words were an adhesive sticker placed on the backglass, probably by an operator, to increase play.

The cabinet side art is the same as that of Keeney's 1961 'Startime'.Depositing a coin at start of game requires pushing the start button to begin play and raises the ball to the playfield. The lit payout odds will stay at position one and the three rows of symbols at far right will flash and stop, lighting either a winning or non-winning sequence. Inserting additional coins will register games on the replay counter. Again pushing the start button will flash the symbols. Player would then keep pushing the start button until a winning sequence is displayed. Player must now shoot the ball and register enough points as noted on the score card to actually \"Win\" the game. A lit \"Wild\" symbol lights all symbols in that row.Game has dual cash boxes. Both cashboxes are accessible to the operator through the front door. The smaller cashbox is accessible to the location owner and would contain his \"take\" of the games coins as determined by the adjustable step unit in the front door area. For example, a \"2 to 1\" plug-in setting would be a \"50-50\" split causing every other coin inserted into the game to be diverted by a relay that kicks the coin over to the location owner's cashbox. The location owner would have a key to the access door to collect his take and always have coins on hand for players.The earliest Billboard ad we found was dated Apr-7-1962, page 100. It was advertised in a list of reconditioned games, which may or may not mean that it had been available awhile.The backglass artist has not been confirmed by us, but the style strongly resembles that of popular Gottlieb artist Charles Leroy Parker. Interestingly, \"Birdland\" was also a New York City jazz club, named for musician and composer Charlie Parker. The club operated from 1949 to 1965."

There are actual burn marks on some of the wood where parts were welded inside of the game.� There were a few extra loose parts in the game (not shown here) that matched up to the installed parts.

Two Rebound Counters were added to the middle playfield using switches that are dissimilar to other switches used in the game. Two flippers were added to the lower playfield, wired to operate independently of each other. All wiring for these additions are not part of the loomed cabling. The blue areas of the playfield look like they were painted over the original art and the owner states these areas flake away fairly easily. These blue areas all have a transparent golden border to them, reminiscent of the borders seen on water-based decals, and these borders may have possibly aged from having been clear when new. The cabinet has been repainted and the paint design underneath has not been determined. The backglass appears to be unfinished in its conversion, having a large black background.The flipper buttons are placed in a nice symmetry on each side of the cabinet, like a factory installation. It seems unlikely that an operator would have converted this game, because the unattractive backglass implies this was not a game that any operator would have purchased to retrofit and then put on location as is. Until more information is known, we believe this game was converted by a company in the business to do such conversions, yet they did not finish the backglass for whatever reason. The score card format and font is similar to the one appearing on 1949�s Bazaar, a flipperless game converted by Nate Schneller, Inc. It is likely Schneller produced this Magik Carpet."

		"notes": "Pictures of the game (not shown here) show a large pin table estimated at 6 feet long and 3 feet wide. The wood cabinet has high walls and no playfield glass. The wood playfield rises midpoint between the players and has a vertical-axis spinner at the center of its crest to block direct shots from one end of the playfield from reaching the opponent's flipper gap at the other end and the goal behind it. There are no posts, targets, slingshots, or pop bumpers; nothing electrical. The coin mechanism accepts 2 francs per game and serves the ball to a nearby opening similar to the cue ball return on a billiard table. The player positioned at the coin door end of the cabinet is the Red Player (red flippers) and plays against the Green Player (dark green flippers), manually placing the ball on a metal habitrail mounted on the top inside of the cabinet to allow the ball to be delivered to center playfield. The flippers appear to be 6 to 7 inches long and are controlled by four large heavy-duty metal T-shaped split-shifter controls, one mounted on top of each corner of the cabinet. Each split-shifter appears to allow separate operation of the applicable front and rear flippers for each player, but this is unconfirmed by us. Each player tracks Goals Scored by moving a marker along a numbered scale on the cabinet's top edge, numbered 1 to 9. The cabinet and playfield are painted yellow while the cabinet end facing the Red Player is painted red and the other end is painted green. The side of the cabinet that was in view appeared to be painted dark red and had the name TAGADA in large light blue letters. This name also appears on a round applique surrounding the center playfield spinner. A cigarette ashtray is mounted on the cabinet top in front of each player.Below the coin mechanism, mounted to the outside of the cabinet near its bottom corner, is the Manufacturer Plate.

		"notes": "The images shown here are of a game that was disassembled before restoration was performed. Some playfield parts were not available in these images.Reportedly, the manufacturer of this game is Automaticos (aka Talleres del Llobregat) but we have been unable to confirm this. Examples we have seen of this game have different cardholders, each without any manufacturer logo. One of the games pictured here does have a cardholder with the Automaticos logo but cardholders are easily taken from other machines. Also, the remainder of the art on that cardholder is not seen on the other known cardholders from that manufacturer and may be home-made. The coil wrappers on examples of this game apparently are not branded like on other Automaticos games. We have one report from a user recalling years ago seeing a plaque on the game indicating \"Talleres del Llobregat\" and dated 1967. Another user remembrance is of a plaque indicating \"Automaticos del Sur\" (South Automatics). A date of 1972 given us has not been sourced. The size of the coin door, the placement of the start button, and the drop-down cabinet does match that of Automaticos' 1970 '7-Up'.We are interested to receive copies of a manufacturer flyer, game manual, schematic, other manufacturer documentation, or a photo of the metal plaque from this game that will confirm the correct manufacturer and possibly a manufacture date or copyright date. Also, we are interested to know if the metal frames of the score reel mechanism carry the name 'Llobregat' on them.'Barbarella' was a character in a French science-fiction comic strip created in 1962. The strips were published as a book in 1964 and adapted into a Hollywood movie in 1968."

It has no legs but rests on a metal stand, typical of the 1930's. The upper and lower playfield aprons are blue in color. The lower playfield is completely open (no components to stop a ball) and shows a large radiating sun design above which appears the name LICA. The upper playfield has eleven long lanes in parallel that each feed a scoring hole at its lower end. Nine lanes each have what looks like a post in its middle to prevent ball passage and surely these posts lower at start of game. The playfield has an outer lane around its perimeter, starting from the shooter lane. The ball is shot into play to travel this lane counter-clockwise around the perimeter, and when the ball reaches the bottom arch of the playfield, the player can operate a large metal lever on the front of the cabinet which mechanically moves or bends this lower arch, thus influencing the direction that the ball takes as it finally enters the playfield area.The instructions on the apron are in French and translate as follows:LICAREGISTERED TRADEMARKINSERT 1 x 25 Cents coin to collect the 10 balls.PUSH the plunger to lift the ball.PULL STRONGLY the shooter and steer the balls using the guide.PULL GENTLY to ease the balls into the holes of the upper surface.THE BLACK BALL doubles the score."

		"notes": "This game was an experimental or test game, modified by Gottlieb. It was assigned a different Model Number than the regular Dancing Dolls production run, even though its cabinet serial number of F20428 falls within the numerical range of that run. The coin door has no coin mechanisms and is wired for free play. The replay wheel in the backbox is numbered in units of five, and the window that shows this number to the player is labeled \"Balls\". The replay unit still steps only one step per point threshold achieved, adding 5 balls to the total ball count for each step, a seeming equivalent of a replay. The lower cabinet has a Delay Unit and an extra relay laced into the cabling, and this unit is equipped with both step-up and reset coils. The schematic diagram identifies the relay as \"Add Delay\" and lists the Delay Unit and its coil numbers. This schematic was not doctored after-factory and shows the model number as 168B with the date 6-7-60 (June 7, 1960). Two original copies of it were included with the game.The owner provided us the following information in 2010:I picked up the Dancing Dolls over a year ago from a man in Grand Rapids, Michigan. He bought the pin over 30 years ago for his kids, now grown and gone.The backglass was manufactured with Balls instead of credits. The backglass is glass [not Plexiglas] and the word \"Balls\" is not a decal or sticker. The Credit Reel is numbered in units of 5 and, when a free game is won, it credits 5 Balls on the backglass. So instead of getting 1 credit for a free game you get 5 Balls, basically the same thing. What's odd is that the machine can be adjusted for 3 balls per game! The extra relay and a Delay Unit A-4501 in the bottom of the case, credit reel, backglass and coin door are all original to the Dancing Dolls and are Gottlieb parts as far as anyone can tell. I painted the coin door and legs similar to the original color. A sticker above the coin slot was either 5 Cents or 10 Cents, I can't remember. I was told the triangle plates on the front of the coin door should have the denomination stamped in them, mine are blank. The game seems to play well and score correctly when the Balls window is blank. When the Balls window shows any units of 5, the motor in the bottom of the case runs continually until the button on the coin door is pressed and a new game starts. I don't know if the button is original to the game or was added later for Free Play, I'm guessing it was original. I have all of the paper work for the Dancing Dolls and everything is in good condition. The pricing cards and instruction cards look to be the same as a regular production game.We did not find part number A-4501 in the exhaustive parts price list in our 1966 Gottlieb catalog. However, that catalog only goes as far back as games dated January 1961 and later.We wondered if this unique game was tied to the development of the add-a-ball feature, an idea conceived by Alvin Gottlieb and which appeared soon afterward on their game Flipper. We contacted Alvin for comment. He advised us that it was not part of the \"Add-A-Ball\" concept but was an attempt to create an \"Extended Play\" mode until David Gottlieb scuttled the idea with the remark, \"Nothing will replace the Free Play as a game attraction\". Because the extended play concept as shown here did not develop any further, we classify this game as a prototype.We have found articles in GameRoom Magazine that identify two earlier games that also had this \"Extended Play\" design. See these listings for the specific magazine issue for each:Gottlieb's 1956 'Classy Bowler'Gottlieb's 1957 'World Champ (Prototype)'"

The cabinet is mounted to its stand on a ball joint to allow for this flexible movement, and four springs are attached to the bottom of the cabinet for stability. The cabinet measures 61 cm long, 56 cm wide, 21 cm high in the front, and 26 cm high in the back.",

Push that lever at maximum stroke and let it return to normal position only once all the balls have drained.3. Raise the balls one at a time using the elevator located on the right side of the machine. Play only one ball at a time and bring it up in front of one of the 3 lanes after running the complete loop by grabbing the 2 handles located on the front of the machine.4. Try to reach the 1000 that is located at the end of each channel trying to avoid the other holes.The game shown here is attached to a flat table-top stand that was made by the current owner using old wood and new springs. The previous owner had used a wrought iron floor stand that he had made. We do not know what the manufacturer's stand looks like, but the current owner stated he had seen this game in a French bistro in the 1980s and it was mounted on a board similar to the one shown here. Although this stand is after-factory, we include pictures of it because the manner in which it is connected to the game cabinet is integral to understanding the operation of this game. Except for this stand, everything else on the game is the manufacturer's original product.An electro-mechanical game with a tilting playfield is International Mutoscope Corporation's 1956 'Rock 'N Roll The Crazy Maze'.A solid-state game with a tilting playfield is Williams' 1983 'Rat Race'."

The backglass artwork is slightly different and it does not have open-elbow inlanes of that game.Much of the game looks like Gottlieb parts. However, the score reel units do not have the expected Gottlieb brand marking. The coil wrappers are labeled A.M.I.  On the backglass, the silkscreened value \"10 Milions\" is apparently misspelled. Also silkscreened on the backglass are one pip from each of three of the four playing card suits: the spade, diamond, and heart. Inexplicably missing is the club pip, and the backbox insert supports this omission. If those art elements are intended to count added balls, we would expected to have seen five of them, typical of other Italian add-a-ball games.The artist has signed both the backglass and playfield as 1977. Both carry a manufacturer logo with the name of this game instead of the name of the manufacturer. For more information on why this is so, read our Glossary entry for Gottlieb Made In Italy.On the game pictured here, the cabinet artwork looks after-factory, but we have no pictures of what the cabinet art should look like, other than comparing it to the Gottlieb export game. Inside the game, the drop-target unit has been removed and some wires have been cut elsewhere, indicating missing components."

The second play is started by again pushing the handle on the coin mechanism, without having to insert another coin.",
		"notes": "The 5 and 10 Pfg coins referenced on the coin mechanism and playfield of this 1937 pin table indicate use of the pfennig coin (plural: pfennige). Starting in 1936, Germany began striking coins with the longer term Reichspfennig marked on their faces, and the 5 and 10 denominations used a composition of aluminum and bronze until 1940, when the composition was changed entirely to zinc. In 1948, both coins were redesigned to use brass-clad steel, the term 'Reichs' was removed, and from this point forward they were again marked only as pfennig.We suspect the pinball manufacturers (and also the public) continued to use the abbreviation \"Pfg\" in spite of the changing nomenclatures for these coins (including  Rentenpfennig). If Blink-Feuer is evidence of this, then we should not use that abbreviation to attempt to identify a game as post-war.However, the changing metallic compositions of these coins suggested fluctuations in weight that might exceed whatever sophistication the coin mechanism may possess to handle all of these coin types while on location, and this may allow us to date a coin mechanism to the range of coins it can handle, therefore helping to narrow the date for which an undocumented game was manufactured. Our research on the two coins found their respective thicknesses and diameters seem to be near constant across the years. The only weight change of probable note was an 18% lighter weight in the 10 Reichspfennig of 1940-1948 than the years before or after.Perhaps 18% is a clue, as it was reported to us that the coin mechanism on this game can be adjusted for the various coins, including today's Euro, which, if true, means it does need to be adjusted. We do not know how flexible the adjustments would be, beyond a possible change of the coin entrance plate. We invite specific education on this point to ultimately find out if this German coin mechanism can be used to date a game."

		"features": "Cabinet measures 76 inches high, 32 1/2 inches wide, and maximum 23 inches deep.This is a floor-standing upright console where balls (probably made of Catalin) are continually fed to the top of a scoring area to roll across a ledge of three metal bars aligned to form an inclined path above nine rollovers. Each metal bar is electromechanically controlled by a button on the front of the cabinet, and using these buttons the player can move any bar to drop a rolling ball to the rollovers below it. The rollovers are designated in groups of three, identified as 'Zones', and they award points when scored. Each Zone has a center rollover able to award additional points if scored when the bulls-eye target light above it is lit. Only one bulls-eye target is lit at a time and this light will switch to another target each time any rollover is scored. In the upper left backglass is a Bulls-Eye 1-2-3 feature to award an extra 8,000 points each time three lit bulls-eyes are achieved (This is the \"Extra Score Feature\" clearly referenced in the schematic identification).  Balls that travel the metal ledge to fall into the far left unmarked lane do not count against the player. Each ball scoring a rollover increments the Zone Shot counter on the backglass. When the allowed number of  Zone Shots is achieved (operator set at 3, 12, or 18), the game is over. There are seven score threshold jacks identified in the backbox as the \"Lifesaver Adjustment\" from which the operator can select up to three of them. When the player's score reaches a selected threshold, a marble will drop into view through a small window located inside the lifesaver artwork on the backglass. These marbles come in five colors and are fed by a large dispenser in the backbox. The machine awards the player nothing for earning these marbles, but the location could provide under-the-counter cash payouts. See our Files section where the manufacturer's Set Up Instructions contains suggestions to operators on how to utilize the \"Marble Feature\".",
		"notes": "This game is not a pinball but is included here for clarification purposes.This game was also produced as a shuffle alley where the rolling balls were dropped not by pressing buttons but by sliding metal pucks across a horizontal wood playfield to hit an area below the backbox to correspond with the three Zones shown on the backglass. In fact, whereas the upright game pictured here indicates on the backglass to \"Press Button To Drop Ball\", the shuffle backglass instructs to \"Shoot Here To Drop Ball\". The shuffle backglass does not have the Bulls-Eye 1-2-3 \"Extra Score Feature\" but does have the Lifesaver feature.The youtube link in this listing is the shuffle version but the backbox scoring operation should be the same.Pictured in this listing is a game that is neither a shuffle alley nor a floor-standing console. It has the backbox of the shuffle alley but has player buttons. We believe it is an operator-modified shuffle version and have marked the image as such.Chicago Coin used the same backbox scoring mechanism on their 1960 'World Series' shuffle alley."

The playfield is similar (but not identical) to that of a game made in Spain, Segasa's 1976 'Casino Royale', while the cabinet art does look the same.Reportedly, this game was made by AMI, a company that would reuse Gottlieb parts and, for the game pictured here, this could explain the Gottlieb box logo on the coin door and the round AMI logo on the coin entrance housing. However, both the backglass and playfield on this game have the box style of logo but with the name of the game appearing inside this box, instead of a manufacturer's name. This method of name-substitution in branding occurred when the manufacturer's supplier sold extra or leftover backglasses and playfields directly to operators and wanted to avoid possible liability. It would appear that the manufacturer who first ordered these Casino Royal backglasses and playfields from the supplier is a user of the box style of logo. Since we know of no Gottlieb game like this one, we wonder if this game was made by an Italian manufacturer like Europlay or Giuliano Lodola, both of whom used the box logo, and perhaps the coin entrance housing and coin door were subsequent operator substitutions."

The photo proves that at least one example of this game was made, probably for location testing.Wayne Neyens said that around November 1, 1954 he designed a turret game called 'Ricochet'. He found notes on a sketch he retained for this game, indicating \"Samples were built but results on test were poor---never built\". 'Ricochet' was also developed as a 4-player game (Model 99) but neither machine was produced.See Gottlieb's 1955 'Ricochet'."

Balls that fall into any of the six drop holes will show up at the ball return trough at the front of the cabinet, presumably to allow the player to shoot them again for more points.

Pictures are need to confirm this.4) There are no instructions displayed on the playfield itself, although the lower playfield left and right plastics have holes for mounting metal holders for instruction and price cards.5) Foul line to first base has text but we cannot read it in the sole picture we have.6) The top edges of the cabinet are trimmed in red, not blue.The card catcher is hard to see in our image but it appears to be a uniform rectangular shape unlike the one used on Model 60021.

		"year": 1932,
		"game_type": "pm",
		"features": "The playfield was advertised as 40 3/4 inches long and 23 inches wide.",
		"notes": "The advertised price for one machine was $89.50. The manufacturer referred to its interchangeable playfields as \"tops\" and an Automatic World advertisement from 1932 (not shown here) indicates that the measurements we display in this listing are its \"top size\" (the playfield only, not the cabinet itself). This ad also states:Our exclusive interchangeable top feature enables you to change from one pin game to another at a very small expense. We have a large selection of tops available at all times. When the game on a certain top seems to lag - pep it up and make it an entirely new game by inserting a new top. Interchangeable tops are available for all tables in numerous designs at $5 each.While this ad states numerous tops existed for each of their three cabinet models of 'Skill Ball', the only picture ads we have found of their interchangeable tops show only three of them, pictured next to the three cabinet models, each top displayed in the ad to possibly suggest it belonged only to the cabinet model pictured nearest it. In the Encyclopedia of Pinball Volume 1, only three tops are listed in an Index, as 'Loop Top', 'Cross Top', and 'Board Top'. Without knowing the measurements of these specific tops, it is hard to conclude which of them are interchangeable with any cabinet model.The ad also states the 'Combination' model is \"Interchangeable from pool to pin table in a few minutes, comes complete with all accessories, balls, cues, etc.\" It does not mention a flat billiard playing surface. We presume from the ad images of this model that the two cue sticks are for two players who would walk around the perimeter of the 'pool table' looking to make shots, just as they would a regulation-size billiard table. That could only mean that the inclined pin-studded playfield shown in the pool table cabinet would be completely impractical for an actual game of pool. Because these ads are promoting the pin game use of this 'Combination' model, perhaps it was left to be implied that this model would come with a flat (and felt-covered) interchangeable billiard playing surface."

According to the Encyclopedia of Pinball Vol 2, this game had two kickers on the playfield when Koehler applied for a patent in August 1934, although no details about the disposition of this patent request are given. Ken Shyvers soon negotiated for the rights to this game, added two more kickers to the playfield, and manufactured it as Shyvers Coin Automatic Machine Company's 1934 'Cannon Fire'. When imitations showed up from competitors. Shyvers vigorously pursued protecting his rights. For that reason, on October 12, 1935, Kohler filed patent 2,070,948 and Shyvers filed patent 2,087,799 the same day. The two patents have identical drawings but non-identical text.By the time the first of the two patents, Koehler's, was approved in February 1937, pinball technology had evolved to render both Cannon Ball and Cannon Fire no longer viable, and Shyvers sold forty percent of his rights to Mr. B.P. Higby of Peoria, Illinois, a collector of patent rights. Due to the legal confusion surrounding ownership, the U.S. Patent Office issued a clarifying report in early 1937 that stated the kicker had a patent Application of August 1934 with a Reapplication in October 12, 1935, and was invented and patented by Frank Koehler of Portland, Oregon and assigned to Ken C. Shyvers of Chicago, Ill."

The playfield is recessed into the cabinet at least 9 inches deep. Due to the angle of the camera, we could not see flippers or flipper buttons. At the top if the playfield appears to be an animating female figurine mounted in a frame. The playfield glass was held in place by a wood frame that is screwed into the cabinet. There is no ball shooter knob on the right front of the cabinet but in the middle of the cabinet front is a large metal handle that appears to pivot. This handle may shoot balls or bat them.Circa 1950's.Reportedly, the gameplay is similar to E. M. Marchant's 1949 'Shooting', a game which also has a handle on the cabinet front. However, the playfield layouts of the two games are different.The manufacturer's flyer shown here spells this game as L'APERO-BALL although the only name visible to us on the game itself is spelled APERO BALL.

The promotional photo shown here is the only evidence we have that this game existed. The photo carries the Stadler Studios negative reference number SS48 1664. That means it was photographed in 1948. We find no mention in contemporaneous Billboard magazines. Since Stadler assigned their numbers sequentially (across all of their clients, not just Williams) we can compare their number on this photo to other promo photos of games for which we have dates, to more specifically place this game in a timeline.SS48 1077 belongs to Williams Model 17 Virginia of March 1948.SS48 1343 belongs to Williams Model 18 Yanks, a baseball-themed game of April 1948SS48 2146 belongs to Williams Model 19 Dew-Wa-Ditty of June 1948.Model 17 and the games preceding it referred to the playfield bonus as the \"Premium Score\". Model 18 and the games following it referred to it as the \"Bonus\". New Orleans used the term 'Bonus' as well.Interestingly, the cabinet artwork of 'New Orleans' is the same as Dew-Wa-Ditty and the lower apron has the baseball score card for Yanks. The backglass resembles the one for Model 24 El Paso of November 1948, a game following Saratoga of October 1948, both marking the first in a series of Williams games named after cities.The playfield layout for 'New Orleans' is different than the games mentioned above so we cannot theorize that it was a prototype for one of those games and that the artwork got changed at the last minute. In the photo, we can see the game had been played because the lower kick-out holes have paint wear and there is ball tracking along the upper ball arch. Some text had been over-painted above the center kick-out hole, evidence that the designer had been adjusting the game rules.Tennessee Williams' 1947 play A Streetcar Named Desire took place in New Orleans and for which he was awarded the Pulitzer Prize in 1948.

This game was located in France.'Les �toiles' translates to 'The Stars'.Circa early 1930's.This game is not to be confused with Lenoble's 1934 'L'Etoile' or Unknown Manufacturer's 'L'Etoile'."

The provider of the game pictured here with an ebony cabinet had stated the number on this cabinet is also 310/1554 even though it is too small to read in the images we provide. Having the same number on two different cabinets makes it an unlikely to be a serial number. The game pictured in Paul Zsolnay's book  Pinball has the number 310/1435 (as seen with an magnifying glass).

The wood playfield rises midpoint between the players and has a small, dark and round object at the center of its crest (we could not identify in the pictures that we saw if it is stationary or if it spins) to block direct shots from one end of the playfield from reaching the opponent's flipper gap at the other end and the goal behind it. There are no posts, targets, slingshots, or pop bumpers; nothing electrical. The coin mechanism serves the ball to a nearby opening similar to the cue ball return on a billiard table. The player positioned at the coin door end of the cabinet is the Red Player (red flippers) and plays against the Green Player (dark green flippers), manually placing the ball on a metal habitrail mounted on the top inside of the cabinet to allow the ball to be delivered to center playfield. The flippers appear to be 6 to 7 inches long and are controlled by eight large heavy-duty metal stick-shift controls, each having a round black ball as its hand grip. Two of them are mounted on top of each corner of the cabinet. These stick-shifters appear to allow separate operation of the applicable front and rear flippers for each player, but this is unconfirmed by us. Each player tracks Goals Scored by moving a marker along a numbered scale on the cabinet's top edge, numbered 1 to 9. The cabinet and playfield are painted yellow while the cabinet end facing the Red Player is painted red, and we presume the other end is painted green. The side of the cabinet that was in view appeared to be painted dark blue and, as best we can discern, had the words FLIPP SHOOT THE NEW MECHANICAL SKIL-FULL GAME. There was no cigarette ashtray mounted anywhere on the cabinet top.This game is very similar but not identical to FRANGAL-AIR Industrie's 'Tagada'.If you own this game or know someone who does, please contact us."

Along the length of the back wall is a slot in the wood hiding a metal rod \"kicker bar\". When non-scoring balls settle along this wall, the player can press either \"flipper\" button to pulse this kicker bar outward, kicking these balls back onto the grid area for possible scoring. The more balls that have already scored, the fewer holes remain available, and the player may have to repeatedly kick the balls back into play until they can score. A strategy is possible when a non-scoring ball rolls along the back wall, allowing the player to time the kick with a desired available hole."

The playfield drawing has a date of 1/4/57, revised 2/13/57, and has the signed initials HEW. The shuffle board drawing has a date of 1/4/57, and has the signed initials HEW. Both drawings carry the incorrect model number of 183 but that can be attributed to the fact that Harry Williams sent his designs to Chicago from another state where he lived and would not necessarily be current with all activity at the Chicago facility. The model number 147 would have been assigned in 1956 so it appears this game took over a year to design. The playfield on the drawings is of a 25-hole bingo playfield and precisely matches the photographs shown here of the Model 147 Yukon bingo game."

Numbers need not be scored in sequence. The two rollovers hidden beneath the center \"?\" plastic determine whether a visible rollover scores for yellow or for orange. Once all the numbers are scored for both colors, power is then applied to a wire which, unfortunately, was found not connected to anything but ends close to the wires which went up to the backbox. Three multi-pin connectors join the playfield to the relay board, and two other connectors connect the relays presumably to the missing backbox. There is no evidence in the lower cabinet to suggest any form of numerical scoring was used in the backbox.",

The playfield shows the manufacture logo in lower case letters.Federico Croci, a collector in Italy, has only a vague recollection of the manufacturer name and otherwise has never seen or heard of this game. The flippers do not say \"flipper\" on them, so he wonders if this game was made after 1965.Federico translates the playfield text as follows:biglie giocate = balls playedbiglia in torretta = ball inside turret (meaning unclear to him)Under the playfield, the wood is stamped BREV.

The playfield has metal rails forming three narrow vertical lanes of four trap holes each, and the narrowness of these lanes makes it difficult to see how a ball in any hole would not block the lane, disallowing other balls to roll past it towards the other holes further down in the lane. Regardless, the three lanes combine at the bottom of the playfield into a single vertical lane that contains two snap traps which are devices that do allow balls to pass by. This final lane drains to the outhole trough at playfield bottom. The playfield is unpainted wood except for a small diamond pip near the upper snap trap and a small heart pip near the lower one. The cabinet front has a coin slide at the extreme left side with a key-locked wood door to its right. The ball shooter knob is in the upper right and the ball lift knob in the lower right.

Legs detach for shipping.Sound: 2 bells.This is a coinless and flipperless head-to-head game where two players at opposite ends of the playfield compete in simultaneous play. No coins needed to operate. The players manually retrieve the balls from trays in the side of the cabinet. Each player drops the balls, one-at-a-time, through a hole in the playfield to place them in front of the ball shooter. The object is to deliver the ball to the opponent's side of the playfield into the center ring (actually a circular trap hole with a bell). The first player to do this five times is supposed to shout \"Cuba Libre!\" to be the winner. Levers on one side of the cabinet allow the trapped balls to be delivered to the trays for the next game. The other side of the cabinet has an opening for the battery pack and power supply. The 12v lithium ion battery pack operates only the illumination as all moving parts of this game require no electricity, allowing the game to fully operate when the battery pack has been removed for overnight recharging.",
